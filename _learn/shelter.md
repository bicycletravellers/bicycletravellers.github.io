title: Shelters for Bicycle Touring
description: "At the end of the day during a long-distance bike touring adventure, you want to experience a nice restful sleep so that the next morning you will be ready to get back on the bike and head out into the world once again. For some people, a nice air-conditioned room in a hotel or motel holds the key to happiness. For others, the lure of the great outdoors beckons them to spend some time outside listening to the frogs' croak and the bugs' chatter. Morning is often accompanied by the sound of birds singing and roosters crowing."
