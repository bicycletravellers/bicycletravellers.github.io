            "text": "Up until now, handlebars have been designed to be strong and stiff as a means to point your wheel in the right direction. Practically speaking, they get the job done, but there’s been serious oversights when it comes to hand, wrist, and arm comfort. For the long rides, it’s all well and good having different positions to hold your bars in, but at the end of the day, we knew something that absorbs the noise of the road would be where the real comfort lies. Through many bicycle touring adventures that have left our wrists and hands in pretty terrible shape, we decided there had to be a better way to face the chatter of a good ride and come out unscathed on the other end. This age-old issue sparked the premise for Passchier Bamboo Handlebars, when Dirk and Mike decided there had to be a better way to take that sting out. Inspired by Dirks history as a craftsman building wooden kayak paddles, the key to these paddles was the stress absorption and upper body comfort they delivered, all attributed to the qualities of the natural fibers used. We quickly understood what had been missing from our ride, and realized that these features could be transferred to the world of two wheels. And so, 3 years ago we put our minds to developing bamboo bars for the touring market, figuring they’re the ones who would require comfort more than any other rider. After testing, building, testing, building, a fair few prototypes and some more tests later, we’d crafted something that was unlike anything we’d ever ridden. 760mm bars built from laminated bamboo with a 22 degree sweep. The bamboo fibers dampened the vibrations of the track, while the slight flex took the stress off our arms and shoulders. The jarring, tingling sensation our hands were so often left with was gone. They ended up proving so comfortable they left you wanting to overshoot your destination and just ride on and on. We decided to call them the Gump… Lo and behold the Passchier Gump bars, named after Forrest Gump, who although not a rider, also just couldn’t stop. We wanted to take the rattle out and that’s certainly what we did – to the point that on the first instance of riding, it’s almost a shock as riders aren’t used to having that bit of flex in their bars, but after a couple of rides try going back to the old ways of alloy or carbon and the stiffness that they possess, the rigidity feels unbearable. It was clear that the Gumps delivered a new level of comfort that is changing the way people ride. Bikepackers began taking them up in New Zealand, using them in the Te Waipounamu and The Great Southern Brevet. We’d seen the vibration damping in action through our testing, but it was the riders responses that proved our bars were delivering exactly what we’d designed them for – “The sensitivity on gravel is unreal”, “I was amazed at the smoothness and lack of sore arms after several varied lengthy descents”, “The flex has taken stress and pressure off my wrists, arms and shoulders on long rides”. They were saving hands and wrists, and riders were finishing 7 day brevets with smiles on their faces. The big questions we get are: You guys have to be crazy – and quite possibly we are. How can you make a bamboo bar strong enough for biking? Undergoing vigorous strength testing, Passchier bars have proven up to ISO standards, as no one likes to eat dirt. Put through 5 days of testing with over 100,000 repeats, the Gumps were pushed to their limits and shown to be perfect for touring, commuting, and easy trail. Are they durable? Being the responsible bike owners we are, we’ve left our bars out in the elements to fear for themselves for the past two years. Being waterproof and weather resistant, the Gumps have remained as good as the day we made them, while our bikes are starting to feel the effects of those hard years. ​​ The Gumps are built for the bikepackers who spend a good bit of time behind their bars. They deliver a comfort we’ve been unable to find with any other bars, and allow the rider to add aero bars or handlebar bags for a right flash looking dashboard on those long rides. With custom colours available if you’re fashion conscious, and a 650mm version for smaller body frames, town cruising, and tighter terrains, i.e. trees or traffic, there’s something for everyone to get onboard and feel what they’re really all about. Ride on…",

            "text": "Hello fellow cyclists! We are Camille and Antoine and we have been traveling by bike for about 8 months. We can say that today is an achievement for us: we crossed Turkey by bike after leaving our home in Montpellier, France. More than 7000km and 80,000m of vertical drop in total, but above all, a transition between Europe and Asia which could not have gone better… TURKEY IS MAGIC! 🇹🇷 We spent 3 incredible months in this country. The landscapes are stunning, there are many impressive archaeological sites and the Turkish welcome is not a legend: the generosity of this people and their desire to welcome travelers is fascinating. It is even more intense when you travel by bike I guess. We will never forget all the people we met, many of whom are now our friends because we had so many good times with them. 🥰 Among our favorite parts, we will undoubtedly remember our cycling days near Mount Ahsan (Ahsan Dağı), the arrival in Cappadocia, the discovery of authentic cities like Ilhara and it’s canyon, the natural pools of Pamukkale, the immense snow-covered deserts of Anatolia, and so on… (It was also very cold, we had several nights at -10°C)❄️ We can only advise you to discover this country that is Turkey, the cultural and visual change of scenery is inevitable. We don’t have time to clearly detail 3 months of adventure so we present the first half of our trip here (about 2000km by bike). We will make another post on occasion to tell you about Eastern Turkey. In the meantime, we hope that our photos will make you want to discover this country. 🤗 And of course, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate! We will answer it with pleasure ✌️ Safe rides, Camille &amp; Antoine Migratory Bikes PS: if you want to discover our adventure more closely, you can join us on Instagram and watch our stories where we talk about our days in detail. https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/migratorybikes",

            "text": "Hi guys, we just spent 2 months in Greece after 6 months in the USA. This is part of our 2-year bike trip with our two girls (9 and 10). Greece is beautiful but 80% covered by mountains. With children riding their bike, you need to be creative if you want them to have a positive experience ! So we didn’t experience the country as cyclists usually do. After several days enjoying Athens, we did some of the Cyclade islands (so beautiful!) and then we did the north of Peloponnese which is fairly flat (and we recommend the train between Athens and Korinthos, very cheap, one every hour and you skip 100km of industrial area). We went down to the Ionian island Zakinthos (breathtaking !) and we did some Workaway for a month in an olive grove for a month near Patra. We’re heading to Izmir (Cesme), Turkey. We’ll take the ferry on Chios island. It’s now open (ferries btw Greece and Turkey used to be closed because of Covid). Again, I checked directly with the ferry company, don’t rely 100% on internet (reservations were still available when it was closed). People in Greece are really nice, ready to help and solution oriented. Careful though, this is low season and post-covid, so information on internet is not reliable (hotels, trains etc…), talk to people to confirm things. We got a very cold winter and even got a snow storm in the Cyclades! It hasn’t happened for 20 years… but it makes a uniquely beautiful scenery. Traffic is ok, probably because of the low season. Avoid downtown Athens but rest is ok. Roads are narrow and no shoulder but people are used to avoid walkers and small motorbikes, so they will be careful with you. On the national roads, there are shoulders but don’t be surprised to see trucks and cars rolling on it, as they use it as « slow vehicles lane » so other cars can pass them. But slow cars go back to the regular lane far from you, no one « is breathing on your neck ».

            "text": "Yesterday we arrived back in Muscat after cycling beautiful Oman for another 24 days (the first round was also 24 days). After being on the road for 20 days without a rest day, we were incredibly exhausted from riding in brutal sun, desert winds, sand and dust and not to forget the crazy climbs we had to take here. I started to develop some fever with dizziness and headache although we made sure each of us drinks about 5 liters of water every day. So the last 4 days back to muscat were a bit if a struggle and every morning I woke up and I really did not feel like going back on the bike anymore. BUT we could not have been any luckier in those 4 days because every day we either got invited for lunch or for a comfortable place to sleep without pitching the tent. We even have been picked-up by someone who gave us a lift for a few kilometers to spare some strong head winds. With the help of those amazing human beings we were able to make it back to Muscat relatively smooth (still in pain and some fever when we arrived) where we will now hibernate in a friend’s house and keep up with all the work we have not been able to do while on the road. I cannot express enough what a wonderful country Oman is for bike touring and I am glad that more people start to come here. Regarding our project Oman has also been a surprise as we never got to talk so much about mental health as we did here as people are very interested in this topic and really want to learn about it. In a few days we will go back to Antalya where we have been invited by Akdeniz Üniversitesi to hold a presentation about mental health and Stigma against people with mental illnesses. Before this we will be visiting a school here in Muscat which has a program for children with special needs and disabilities and represents a good example of inclusion here in Muscat.",

And I wanted to say thank you 🙏 You might already know we had some problems with our gear. After a week of a little break in Muscat Oman, where we tried to fix our gear, we are the road again! My back rim is still not fix, we could not get a spare rim for me, so I still riding the cracked rim with less load and less air pressure. Please Keep your finger cross🤞 for us. Oman is very beautiful! And I just wanted to share some pictures with you 😊. On the road we also work on our little side project! We have soon an exciting announcement to make. 😊 Greetings from Oman",

            "text": "Tank top, sweater, light sweatshirt, heavy sweatshirt and windproof jacket. 😱 I wore all my bike repertoire and yet a damn draft, one of those that make you shiver from head to toe, managed to get through this time too. 😓 The wind from the north-west, the direction in which we are pedaling, slaps us violently. At certain moments he is so stubborn that it seems to crash into an invisible and insurmountable wall and does not advance. Not even a meter. Yet it seemed to be a beautiful day with a turquoise sky and a bright sun lighting up the tent when we woke up… ⛺ Now we have to admit it to ourselves: it’s January, winter has arrived here in Turkey and the temperatures have dropped drastically in recent days, so abruptly that the thermometer marks -16 ° C. ❄️ We arrive in Göksun at sunset, exhausted and cold as we have not been in months, after a day of battle against the windmills, like real Din Quixote. 😱 The trendy cut young man smiles thoughtfully. Sitting at the reception desk of the hotel he is a bit hesitant: “Dogs wouldn’t be allowed, but if you guarantee me it won’t dirty or cause disasters …” 🐶 We guarantee with grateful eyes for the confidence because today, with these temperatures and our insufficient equipment, it would have been a “cool” ordeal sleeping outdoors. It takes us half an hour to recover a normal body temperature, while it will take much longer for us to decide to change our travel plans again.❄️ When you have a destination in mind, it’s hard to get it out of your head to make room for other places. It’s like leaving a door ajar when it should be closed or open We fall asleep upset and even more confused by our own thoughts that cloud the mind and disturb sleep. Nala, quatta quatta, taking advantage of a gap between our feet, jumps on its cover lying on the bed, conquering half the mattress in a few minutes. Sometimes I just don’t realize how long she is lying down 🐶 In the morning, after hours that are anything but restful, most of the doubts are resolved: we jump in the saddle and turn the wheels of our bicycles in favor of the wind, to the south, aiming for the Mediterranean Sea and leaving behind - not without regrets - the Cappadocia fairy chimneys, -16 ° C and 20 cm of abundant snow expected for the next few days.❄️ Will we have made the right choice? Is there a right choice? Who will live, will see 😉 #backtothewest More photos and stories on our instagram page: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lifeintravel.it\/ or on our fb page Bicycle Touring 😍",

            "text": "Hello everyone !! Above all, we would like to wish you all a happy new year! Let’s hope the air chambers won’t die, that the wheels won’t veil and that the the cyclist adventures will go on for this year 2022 🥳🥳 As you may know, we are traveling by bike with my partner and we have just arrived in Istanbul from Montpellier (south of France). About 5,500km and 60,000m of elevation to enter the Asian continent!! We are very happy with these first months but we are still far from Nepal 😅 We share with you here our thoughts on Albania and Greece, which were just incredible to cycle with the winter settling in the mountains. In Albania, we had a lot of rain, which allowed us to meet many locals in difficult moments. The reputation of the Albanians is well deserved, they are undoubtedly the most benevolent and friendly people we have met: we have been accommodated several times, many inhabitants gave us food, sometimes even on the road, and even if hardly anyone speaks English in the hinterland, we spent extremely funny evenings. It is also a magnificent country, in short, just perfect for the cycle traveler! For Greece, we expected a country more typical of “Western Europe”, and we were very pleasantly surprised going through the mountains to reach the gorges of Vikos, in the north of the country. You don’t feel any difference with Albania except the language, the people are also very kind and nice. On the other hand, the weather conditions were very difficult: we rode one day near a lake at an altitude of 1300m with a feeling of -15°C, and a really cold night at -8°C. But the landscapes were there, and we were motivated by the idea of ​​reaching Meteora for Christmas Eve. Between the monasteries, the mountains and the seaside, Greece is really varied and pleasant to travel by bike out of season. Good day to all, and beautiful adventures to those who are on the road! 😘 Camille and Antoine from Migratory Bikes https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/migratorybikes",

To legally leave Chile, after 1 year and 4 months, we decided to take a flight to Cusco and start cycling north again on the cordillera till almost Ecuador. At that time the land borders were still closed, so to reach Panama, we decided to take a flight to Cancun, Mexico, and cycle south through central America 😄 At the moment we are in Honduras Here some pics from Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador Cheers",

Back from 2 days of fever, I get back on my journey, cycling on the cycle path that runs along the Rhine river, from Cologne to Frankfurt, where from Rhine, it becomes the Main. The cycle path is very well made and intuitive, you don’t even need to look at the map. It is part of the EuroVelo 15 (highly recommended) so just follow the directions on the route 👌 You will find fairytale sceneries, surrounded by vineyards and castles on the hills 😍 I can’t cover the km I set out to do, the fever had weakened me a lot, so after 172km I stop in a small but very nice village, Oberwesel.
