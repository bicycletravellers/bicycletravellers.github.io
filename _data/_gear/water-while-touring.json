Ever noticed how salty your body gets after sports? <b>We exude&nbsp;a fair amount of salt&nbsp;when sweating.</b> This salt is necessary for the good functioning of the body notably by helping the transmission of nerve influx to your muscles and organs. This is why sports drinks such as Gatorade, PowerAde and the like contain a lot of water and a little bit of salt. They also contain some sugar for taste and energy. Similarly, there are packets of electrolytes on the market to help people suffering from dehydration; these essentially contain&nbsp;salt and a bit of potassium. Talking about potassium, bananas contain a lot of potassium and are cheap, tasty and full of good sugar… they are, in my opinion, the ultimate cyclist’s snack."

Sometimes, the thought of drinking tepid water is so unappealing that we prefer skipping an otherwise needed drink. There are a few tricks to help you keep your beverage cold for a longer period: some people add ice and others use insulated bottles. Since you can rarely find ice when on tour and that insulated bottles only work for a few hours, I believe nature offers us a better method for keeping the content of our bottles cool."

The trick is very simple and only requires an old cotton sock and an elastic band. By placing a sock around your bottle and securing it there with an elastic band, you have created a perfect envelope that should keep moisture near the bottle. Then, you simply have to fill your bottle and pour a bit more water on the sock. Once the sock is wet, all you need to do is to pedal so that the wind helps at evaporating slowly the moisture; this should cool down the bottle and its content. Many are extremely sceptical of this very simple solution; to them, I simply say: try it and judge afterwards!"
