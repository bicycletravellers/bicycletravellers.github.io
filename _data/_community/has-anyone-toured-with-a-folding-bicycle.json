They became popular when the cost of taking a bike on a plane skyrocketed and many still use them. I personally prefer a bike with normal-sized wheels (and I believe there are some folders that have such) for when I encounter rougher terrain.  I also note that a long-reach rear derailleur comes very close to the ground when the wheels are so small and I‚Äôd be sure to damage it.\n\nI have a bike that‚Äôs not a folder but fitted with S&amp;S couplers so the frame comes apart for packing in a 26x26x10 suitcase (maximum size without being oversized).

Great for mixed mode touring, riding, busses, trains, ferries, etc when you don't have the time to do long haul rode days but want to see as many regions of a destination as possible. I own and have toured on a Bike Friday NWT and a KSH F20 JJ. KSH is a ridiculously good bike at a ridiculously cheap price.
