The reason is the that the tires and tread patterns are very different for the different disciplines.\n\nI do a lot of training on my Trek Procaliber. I run bar-ends inboard to mimick a hood poition on a dropbar, and can practically churn out a similar speed as my heavier gravel bike that has panniers on it, but it's faster off-road, and second \"more aero\" hand position helps. However, if I swapped out the wheels to the 700x50 American Classic Kimberlites it would be faster still. The only problem with a HT MTB is you're largely limited to bikepacking bags and no rack but in almost every case, a compromise between no water in the frame and a frame bag, camelbak or no framebag which means you're going to have a minimalist setup. You can attach stuff to the forks, but its not always a good idea if they're suspension forks. But for a \"One bike stable\", a hardtail MTB is hard to beat for versatility.\n\nThe advantage of a gravel bike....especially one that accommodates chunky rubber is the outright speed both on and offroad, comfort and more places to mount packs. You can fit more stuff on the bike with more attachment points......without jumping through hoops to create attachment points.

For me this is more of a flat bar versus drop bar question. I love the range of tires available on a rigid mountain bike and I'm a huge fan of flat bars for gravel.\n\nIf you would like I can give you my reasons for preferring a flat bar.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/a-bicycle-that-can-do-it-all-gravel-vs-cross-country-mtb/image_1655882423_3949728733.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Ian Ramsey","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_370280","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Ian Ramsey\"> I am interested</span></div>","author":"Cody Perkins","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_402391","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Cody Perkins\"> I prefer flat bars and here's why:\n\nWhile I concede that drop bars have a greater variety of hand positions, the greater variety of hand positions only works if you move your hands around a lot. \n\nThe reach of a drop bar bike is set for your position on the hoods. So if you move into the drops your reach will lengthen if you move onto the tops your reach will shorten.  Neither of these positions may be as comfortable as the hoods for long periods of time due to the change in reach or access to shifters and brakes.\n\nI would argue that you move your hands around more on a flat bar. Simply moving my thumbs from being wrapped around the handlebar to the top of the handlebar redistributes pressure from the radial side of my palm to the ulnar side.  Add a pair of ergon grips and you significantly increase the ways you can distribute pressure into your hands.  \n\nGenerally, drop bar bikes have a lower stack height which can put more pressure on your hands, neck and low back.  \"For every inch of forward head posture, it can increase the weight of the head on the spine by an additional 10 pounds.\" (Kapandji)\n\nFlat bars have significantly better control over rougher terrain.\n\nI believe the aerodynamic argument in favor of drop bars does not hold water. If you look at the most aerodynamic positions used in the pro peloton at a race like the Tour de France you will see the super tuck (before being banned) with hands on the flat close to the stem or hands on the hoods with the forearms flat.  Both of these positions have been shown in wind tunnels to be more aerodynamic than riding in the drops.  Both of these positions are easily replicable on a flat bar.  In fact, I would argue that the position with hands on the tops, close to the stem, is easier to replicate on a flat bar because you don't lose reach.\n\nHere's a non-scientific demonstration of this (watch to the end and no, it's not \"cheating\"):\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/lqSbc0qjVZk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/lqSbc0qjVZk</a>\n\nThe idea that you can't be competitive without drop bars is also not a valid argument. Here's an example:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cxmagazine.com/pro-bike-profile-carl-decker-giant-xtc-advanced-lost-found-2017-gravel-race\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.cxmagazine.com/pro-bike-profile-carl-decker-giant-xtc-advanced-lost-found-2017-gravel-race</a>\n\nI also think the whole handlebar setup is lighter and much less susceptible to damage in a crash.\n\nIn my opinion, if there's a place where drop bars are clearly superior to flat bars it is when sprinting. But sprinting is such a minor part of long distance gravel cycling that it seems to be an insignificant benefit.\n\nHere's my argument for why a rigid 29er makes a perfect gravel bike:\n\nThe frame is designed for flat bars. See above.\n\nA higher stack height, generally found on mountain bikes, makes for a more comfortable ride.  In my opinion, the longer the ride the more important comfort is.  A higher stack height gives greater flexibility for taking weight off of your hands and neck. \"For every inch of forward head posture, it can increase the weight of the head on the spine by an additional 10 pounds.\" (Kapandji)\n\nGreater tire clearance. I can still ride skinny road tires or I can put on wider mountain bike tires. Giving me a lot more control over my setup depending on what course I'm riding. And wider tires can greatly improve comfort.  I have different sets of wheels and tires for different terrain.</span></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FlqSbc0qjVZk&amp;h=AT1NHn9VyjGV5nND4jN36m2T17fIubVCHHnl066Kg7s9HmpcU9edBALgabWwxfqZjVDOwgDLPRmgth-Fe8ez7FKXzAEFcxoIpFDuMzTowfginLmGGna0gLMZSdfMVKmmY0CZYrHkcu1fWqg&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lqSbc0qjVZk/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Drop Bars Vs Flats | Can A Hybrid Bike Be Just As Fast As A Road Bike?</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">youtube.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Ian Ramsey","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_697228","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Cody Perkins\"> I also have three pairs of wheels for this bike.
