After 5 weeks and 1800 miles with no cramping issues, we flew home for some family matters - we completed riding Wednesday. On Friday, my quad cramps started and they continue to persist. They are enough to prevent me from riding, even just a short spin.\n\nToday I will be going in for a therapeutic massage. Also, I have been downing a lot of Nunn electrolytes. It was recommended that I resume the daily beer that I had while we were touring, which I will begin today.\n\nDo you have any additional insights or recommendations? We will be resuming our tour in another week or two.</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_530327","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_262276","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Lack of magnesium?</div>","author":"Sheree Sonfield","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_348647","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Bananas are great for hydration.</div>","author":"Rob Peters","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_850867","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Magnesium - works every time</div>","author":"Rosie Browne","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_134016","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I would try some quad stretches.

If it is cramps of course the muscle will get rock solid and all the suggestions in the thread will help.  In my case, it was not actually cramps but an unusual pain in the muscle fascia surrounding the quads and was so painful I could not complete a single stroke on the crank. The timing of the problem was also confusing because I would not get the pain if riding every day but only after taking a few days off and then resuming.  The muscles themselves did not get that rock solid cramping feel but the symptoms were very similar and so important to know what is going on.  The \"answer\" in my case was to quickly seek medical help but more importantly to add yoga into my weekly routine.  The yoga was not focused just on stretching but more towards making the fascia and connecting tissues more pliable and this needs to be done in a gradual way so as not to introduce more inflammation.  So first things first, determine if these are truly cramps or something else.
