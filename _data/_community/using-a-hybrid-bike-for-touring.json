Gravel bikes usually have drop bars, similar to a road bike, but a bit more flared at the sides, &amp; the forks allow you to put wider, grippier tires on them than a road bike. \nMore detail in the ‚Äòtypes of bikes‚Äô section on this link:\n\n<a href=\"https://bikepacking.com/bikepacking-101/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bikepacking.com/bikepacking-101/</a></span></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbikepacking.com%2Fbikepacking-101%2F&amp;h=AT2W9edz4ZEZwBRLteVWYI1A6MCh_HJEP_DrUx9g4vw5IX7H8GhXr_9CPMhJUDnERgQ8wOLbYIfViU3VBMgcCXVW1zh_3So7mMtAPQR88eajc3oihXIAXNZr101luQiUFAxIeHrmb9LP0oulHNzyYheDibqG0ZU7G90&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bikepacking-101-cover.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Bikepacking 101</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">bikepacking.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Cheryl Leskiw","gender":"FEMALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_501632","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Cheryl Leskiw\"> thanks!

That is to say, they might hold up, components tend to go quicker than the bicycle manufacturer‚Äôs respective parts.  So check the components on your own rig before switching over to blacking/touring.  I think upgrading to a decent gravel bike will have a lot of value for you.
