You would need to fully degrease your drivetrain every time you switched from wet to dry. This ain't a problem usually if you're just switching as you go from winter to summer each year, but isn't going exactly convenient for what you're going to be doing.\n\nIf the weather is that unpredictable then I think you'll just need to pick one and stick with it.\n\nDry lube will be less messy, but you'll need to apply it really often if it rains a lot. It also needs to sit and dry overnight or for at least an hour or two in order to work properly, so just reapplying it through the day isn't very effective. It'll be fine just doing it at the end of each day if you're just getting a short bursts of rain through the day and aren't losing it all. You'll know when it's gone and your chain starts squeaking.\n\nWet lube is messier and far less popular as a result, but it it'll have better staying power if you'll be in torrential rain constantly.\nThe trick with the wet stuff is thay you don't need as much as you think. You only need the lube to be in the rollers of the chain, so all the stuff that leaks out can be wiped off. Do this often.\n\nIf you're willing to carry both, then maybe use the dry stuff until it fails. You never know - that might never happen, but if it does then you can switch to wet lube. Once you're on the wet lube though, it won't be possible to switch back without a full degrease. You may be able to just carry a bottle of Smoov or whatever and if it isn't working out then just buy some wet lube on the road.</span></div>","author":"Dave Henderson","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_153942","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Dave Henderson\"> I'm going to try some wet lube this time, I have used dry stuff before, It also needed to sit overnight and it came off pretty quickly.

Just keep the drivetrain wiped down plenty. If you're in dusty or sandy conditions the wet lube will really attract stuff to stick to it and it'll turn into a grinding paste on your drivetrain. I've experienced that before and it's actually unbelievable how quickly it happens and how much damage it does - its possible to total a cassette in a 3 day trip! \nOnly apply as much as the manufacturer states and wipe it down when it looks dirty.
