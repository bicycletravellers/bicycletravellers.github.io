I have a RadRunner Plus that i have never used for long distance. I have two batteries and each on a full charge is supposed to get 40+ miles.

I was thinking I would start early and ride till the first is dead and find a coffee shop or something to chill and recharge for about 4 hours and then finishing the ride. I am mainly curious on any challenges ebike riders have had vs a normal bike. I don't normally have problems doing a century on a normal bike but this time around I will be camping for two weeks in one location and want to carry more gear than usual.</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_812780","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_935516","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Following</div>","author":"Christine Gibbons Nigida","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_319210","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Iâ€™ve been looking into one but I believe the one you have is a Class 2?

They include members who have travelled the oregan trail and various other existing pathways in the states. I am currently following a story of one posters adventures of travelling from Vermont to the Florida keys - I am hoping to gather tips and hints from this page and the other page so that I can undertake an epic bike trip of my own - although admittedly fear is stopping me undertaking the adventure currently.
