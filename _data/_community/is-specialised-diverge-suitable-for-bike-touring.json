To me it seems like there's too much emphasis in many people's minds about getting the best gear in preparation for the cycling rather than on the cycling itself. It's like a consumerist anxiety, the need to maximize. I'm not immune to it myself and I did ask on this forum about brooks saddles earlier in the year, so I'm not knocking it entirely, there's some good sharing of experiences here. But bottom line is that any bike, any saddle, any whatever, is enough to start the journey.
