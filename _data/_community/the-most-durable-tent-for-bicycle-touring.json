Heavy at 8 lbs., yes, but I lost 10 lbs. off of my body to compensate for it.  My camping would be considered overly comfy by most serious bikepackers and tourers.  The point really is though that the same company makes 1, 2 and 3 person tents in this line too, and they are very nice and quite durable, and the price is also nice.  The aluminum poles are a good diameter and the #8 zippers are sturdy.\n\n<a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/ALPS-Mountaineering-Lynx-4-Person-Tent/dp/B00B7N6R0Q/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2E92HUBGOSYH0&amp;keywords=alps+mountaineering+tents&amp;qid=1648778962&amp;sprefix=alps+m%2Caps%2C416&amp;sr=8-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://smile.amazon.com/ALPS-Mountaineering-Lynx-4-Person-Tent/dp/B00B7N6R0Q/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2E92HUBGOSYH0&amp;keywords=alps+mountaineering+tents&amp;qid=1648778962&amp;sprefix=alps+m%2Caps%2C416&amp;sr=8-3</a></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsmile.amazon.com%2FALPS-Mountaineering-Lynx-4-Person-Tent%2Fdp%2FB00B7N6R0Q%2Fref%3Dsr_1_3%3Fcrid%3D2E92HUBGOSYH0%26keywords%3Dalps%2Bmountaineering%2Btents%26qid%3D1648778962%26sprefix%3Dalps%2Bm%252Caps%252C416%26sr%3D8-3&amp;h=AT2BxQkLdP6WimztjLQvvYYCZpYEOSxrXaS89q-aJBBYVzdC3D8kNap1LnqZl_iQSMv2UOTJhrueF-WJXW4WqvoHFA3g-Pf-cMlRfJSeZBCaLueP5mbojl4fN45zrnZHr45-jYbffZXpoZU&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41EufowjOwL._SR600%2c315_PIWhiteStrip%2cBottomLeft%2c0%2c35_PIStarRatingFOURANDHALF%2cBottomLeft%2c360%2c-6_SR600%2c315_ZA768%2c445%2c290%2c400%2c400%2cAmazonEmberBold%2c12%2c4%2c0%2c0%2c5_SCLZZZZZZZ_FMpng_BG255%2c255%2c255.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">ALPS Mountaineering Lynx 4-Person Tent</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">amazon.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Diane Farley","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_584509","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Diane Farley\"> I bought a three man tent for my travels because it seems that the one and two man tents are made for people under 61\" in length.
