Big discounts on at least in the UK as discontinued. Does not have MIPs but had POCs own version which they have now dropped in favour of MIPs. Huge step up in comfort and quality from my previous Giro Foray. One thing to be mindful of is the lack of adjustment on the ear straps which may make the helmet a poor fit for people with large or low ears. Mine just fits. Within 3 days of buying I slammed the car boot lid shut on my head, the helmet did an excellent job of protecting the space in my head which is obviously void of brains.

There is no substitute for going to shops and trying them on and see which one is the most comfortable.  A lot of it will depend on the size and shape of your head.  For me, Giro fits very well, and Bell and Smith are also quite comfortable.  On the other hand, I was leaning towards getting one of those Bontrager wavecel helmets and then tried one on.  Nope, not made for my head.  I bought a Giro and it fits like a glove.  But, for you, it might be the exact opposite.  I also second (third) the recommendation to pay a little extra for one with MIPS.</div>","author":"Justin Stephen","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
