I've done the bladder in a frame bag thing too, and it's simply not the same.  The lack of slop and how efficiently the cranktank uses space can't be beaten. Also,  I hate to the point of dry reaching that horrible plastic taste... but have never experienced it with the cranktank. Granted,  if you have stuff lying about gathering dust you might want to use that first,  but if you're buying afresh because you are starting without the necessary hydration equipment,  cranktanks are cheaper/lighter/ bigger than most options. I especially like how I could easily add a quick release near the bite valve, then use a cnoc-befree setup as a direct-to-cranktank gravity filter system. Admittedly,  I'm in New Zealand so the postage isn't too much of a problem - one of the most substantial disadvantages is getting a cranktank sent to northern hemisphere.</div>","author":"Brad Coombes","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
