If we don’t buy bikes, bikes don’t get built.  If bikes don’t get built, pretty soon bikes will cost way more than a 3 year old car.\n\nIn the US, you can buy bikes for cheap but you get a really, really cheap bike…as in one that can’t really be ridden for more than a few hundred miles at best.  Big Box stores sell bikes for $100 and I can tell you horror stories about the how bad they are.  Bearings that grind to hemispheres before 500 miles, wheels that collapse from even the slightest sideways pressure, and spindles like the one above that are cracked and broken.  \n\nWheel collapse and the spindle are safety issues.  The owner of the spindle above was one stand away from having the spindle shear on either side (the other side of the spindle looked exactly like this side) which, at best, could result in a crash and at worst result in a severe laceration.\n\nBikes can be made for cheap that won’t last and can be a danger to the owner or they can be made a higher cost that will last a whole lot longer.  Ignore the excessively expensive bicycles.  There are plenty of reasonably priced bike ($500 US and slight above) that are safe, durable, and well built.</span></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/bioncekipost/image_1660581009_8809802556.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Stuart Black","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_44075","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Stuart Black\"> wow, have never seen a BB spindle break before, that must be really crap metal...</span></div>","author":"Peter Harger","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_914579","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Stuart Black they make low quality basic bukes so that you go for pricey ones ...

I've only had the wheels re-trued once in 2 years (checked every year, only needed adjustment once on one wheel), and the derailleurs and shifters are still smooth as silk. I'm not a huge fan of the disc brakes, as I'm more comfortable working on caliper brakes myself, but we haven't had any issues with them in 2 years, unlike the cheap bike, that I was adjusting at least every 6 months.\n\nShe rode 200 miles in a week during RAGBRAI (she's 11), and the bike was completely fine during that entire adventure.</div>","author":"Elizabeth Wiczer","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_634464","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">No peer pressure...

The ones you can order on the internet?30 years ago in Vancouver I commuted to work on a Gitane.  It wasn’t a $50 bike but was definitely less than a 3 year old used car.   The panniers, wet weather gear, non-MIPS helmet, DIY repair and cleaning gear cost me more than $50 you say was the price of a bike 15 years ago.  At the time the bike names I recall were Gitane, Peugeot and Norco (local BC brand).  I am sure there were more but as a commuter I wasn’t looking at racing bikes and soft tailed mountain bikes weren’t a thing.  The supply pool was what the LBS had or what you could buy second hand.  I still find that to be the case.   The LBS shops bring in what they think they can sell for each style/type of biking and yes, that is marketing by the manufacturers to the shops and to the prospective customers but I find very few in the shops that are for distance touring.  Most are MTB, road or urban/commuters and the price links to at what level you wish to operate at.  A couple of days ago when in the shop the main floor was dominated by ebikes which is about 50% of the bikes I see on the flatter urban trails where I live now.  A whole new demographic of slightly older, creaky people can now get out and climb a few hills but there is a range of price points based upon stripped down looks or the equivalent of a BMW.  A lot of research, sophisticated materials and design has gone into the pricier bikes driven by the choice of what you ride for the purpose you ride it for, particularly if you are using the bike competitively. \n\nAs a final comment, sophistication and pricing seem to have gone up in all sports/hobbies.  You really want a scare - look at the prices of good espresso machines and the snobbery around the home brew crowd.  Some of the home use manual machines are truly around the price of a 3 year old used car.</div>","author":"Michael Kelly","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_726331","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">The riders with the oldest equipment and most home made accessories get the most appreciation.

What has happened is an influx of new people in to cycling (road. MTB and gravel - although most of those started as road).  Those new people have a completely different set of values, notable of which are material values, image and one up man ship (beat the other guy).  The bike brands are capitalising on this.  If you just see this (large group) and the companies working to capitalise out of them as off to the side of the traditional core of cycling which I and you identify with then my response is to let that be and just carry on as we were.  The issue you raise though is how this has made bikes hugely expensive, which I agree with.  Some options are: join a counter culture (steel is real, recumbents, 90 MTBs, old touring bikes) or take advantage of the fact that the image conscious folk want new bikes every few years to keep up with the Jones and don’t need their old bikes and some don’t actually put many kms in the bikes.  So their second hand bikes become the reasonable price stock for us.\n\nFor me, I appreciate the second hand MTB that are way more capable than the MTBs of the 90’s and counter culture ride recumbents and tandems.</div>","author":"Aaron Davis","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_981845","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Aaron Davis\"> I don't that those issues worry me , each to their own.

From a bikeability instructors point of view in terms of kids bike, so many are built unfit for purpose m. We know people especially don’t want to spend a lot on kids bikes when they grow out of them, but so many kids are hard to teach because of their bike. Things like the break levers too far from handle bars for the kids to reach, crappy gears, crappy breaks, wrong ergonomics. For a decent new kids bike like Isla bikes or frog, you are talking in the region of £500. But there is a scheme in uk where you pay about £10 a month and they replace with a bigger bike every 18 months. We also need to start thinking about servicing kids bikes so they can be passed down.
