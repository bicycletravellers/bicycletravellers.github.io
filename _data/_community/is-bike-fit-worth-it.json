For height, I use the simple method of riding/coasting with my heel on the pedal and adjusting the saddle for full leg extension a the bottom of the stroke. When you ride with proper foot positioning, this will give you a slight bend in the knee. For fore/aft position, I run a plumb line from my knee down through the pedal spindle of the forward pedal when cranks are parallel to the ground. I use a lead fishing weight on a string. You can do this alone, but a second person helps. Lots of web pages and videos on this. Lastly, I set my bar position using Lee McCormick's RAD approach which you can see here (this is the less complex of his approach and leaves you with a helpful tool for setting up any bike's RAD). I cannot stress enough how helpful the RAD setup is (though it doesn't touch on saddle position): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHagRovHSYs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHagRovHSYs</a></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrHagRovHSYs&amp;h=AT0g-IT_Dh6iYD_IH3kgZ4qlJfOM7_wDZoDGphYeYcieqgEx5T4dY8w9gStpbaylZS1H1nRMzMBQLdA3-bkOibtRYyQ5LlISKJOwD6vMTh7mGj_1cqouMZIP4jmpfe0lQ_ITHdoma58OVyM&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rHagRovHSYs/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">HOW TO FIT A MOUNTAIN BIKE TO YOUR BODY | Free Fit Kit</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">youtube.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Wade Patterson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_883572","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Wade Patterson\"> I'll check this out</span></div>","author":"Miltiades Konstantaras","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_989682","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I've seen some very poor bike fits.

If your bars are lower than the saddle negative nose is key. Even if they are level, sometimes a degree of negative nose is nice. Me I use about 3 negative on my road bike. And 2 on my gravel. But my gravel seat is not ideal at 136mm...i need a 142-144 which is my ideal because it supports me on my sit bones. 136 is miserable even after I get \"broken in\" to riding. Don't worry, I just ordered a 144 after a season on the 136.</div>","author":"Justin Serpico","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_558785","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Check out SQLabs for saddle fit.
