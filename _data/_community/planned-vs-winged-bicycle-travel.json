Sometimes bad weather hits, and you can't put in the number of miles you expected. Or any other many issues that could cause you to go shorter or longer than expected. So we almost always book hotels as we go, calling maybe halfway through the day to lock something in, or sometimes just showing up and booking on the spot. One challenge with that is if you are in a busy, popular area, hotels could be booked. And in very remote areas, you might only have one lodging choice. So it could pay in some places to lock in your lodging. As for the route, we usually adhere to it, but occasionally in the middle of a trip, we'll tweak our route a bit. Again, leaning towards winging it more than planning every last detail.</div>","author":"Dave Elmstrom","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_593111","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Little of both, because something always goes wrong w/ plans !</div>","author":"Toby Homsher","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_613194","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">My first trip was very unplanned just because I suddenly had the opportunity and a willing accomplice.\nGenerally I have a lot of time to plan, so I do, and very little time to execute.</div>","author":"Casey Walters","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_318774","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Guesstimate</div>","author":"Keith Palmer","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_319375","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">SWAG it.

We ate our reserve dehydrated meals that night.  \nI work as a commercial construction manager, and therefore believe if you fail to plan, plan to fail.

Actual ¬´planning¬ª is kept to a minimum. The freedom that going with no set distance or route give let me realx, enjoy - and just be.\n\nAs an example, I cycled coast-to-coast in the US (New York to Los Angeles via Canada and Mexico) at 14 days notice. I cycled the whole distance ¬´alone¬ª with my 8 kids (aged 12 months to 17 years old). The ¬´planning¬ª was limited to arranging formalities around home schooling (for 5 kids), visas, and air tickets (to New York and return tickets from LA 9 months later). The rest, including route, we just ¬´winged it¬ª as we cycled. We had an amazing experience, and cycled the while trio without a map. Wild camping most if the nights, pickng durections based on the sun, prepearing shopping and distances based on the road signes.\n\nThis is one way to travel, but not the only one. Sometimes you need to plan a bit to be safe (remote areas, terrain, weather/temperature) or due to technicallities (visas, border crossings, ferries, air travel) - and ofcourse, the more time constrained you are, the more planning is needed.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/planned-vs-winged-bicycle-travel/image_1655452759_5068931276.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Martin Vest√∏l","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_759311","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I like having a final destination in mind but winging it on how I get there.
