The bike features a mismatched pair of carbon wheels, the original DT Swiss XMC 150 rear wheel with a Maxxis Dissector, and a Whisky Parts No. 9 front wheel with a Maxxis High Roller II. The Whisky Parts wheel was built with a Shutter Precision PD-8X Dynamo hub as a power solution. The drivetrain is the original 1×12 X01 Eagle and the pedals are Look X-Track Race Carbon pedals. The seat post is a 175mm Fox Transfer but is limited with a Wolftooth Valais. Upfront is a Bar Yak Ultra 35 on the handlebars for bag support.\nBAGS: This setup is a full complement of Rockgeist bags. This includes a custom frame bag, two Honeypot Feedbags attached to a spacelink, Cache Top Tube Bag, custom Medic Top Tube Bag, Foxglove Saddlebag, and a BarJam Harness. All of the bags are made from VX21 Black except for the Barjam Harness (VX42) and the Foxglove Saddlebag (Dyneema). The Barjam Harness holds a Sea to Summit eVent Compression dry sack. I also use a Woho XTouring Anti Sway to bring extra stability to my saddlebag and to provide additional water storage. Around the saddlebag holding my sandals and other items is a custom Kemp Keeper by Charlie Kemp.\nGEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I handle navigation with a Hammerhead Karoo II and live tracking with a Garmin inReach Mini. The dynamo hub powers a kLite Bikepacker Ultra V2 through a dual USB charger. The charger also powers the inReach Mini as well as a backup battery. Downtime is covered with the Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2 tent along with a Big Agnes Star Fire UL 30° and Therm-a-Rest Neoair Xlite Sleeping pad.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/can-a-full-suspension-mountain-bike-be-used-for-bikepacking/image_1657875435_6447621679.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Adam Rouillier","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_772409","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">With full suspension pack very light.
