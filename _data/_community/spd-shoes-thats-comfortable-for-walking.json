They make SPD shoes that look like hiking shoes but I find they're waaaay to stuffy for hard riding, my feet get swampy in them, I don't use the style anymore. I own a pretty big collection of cycling shoes (from like $80 to $400), and honestly the most comfortable are the ~$100-150 sporty ones. Velcro straps wear out quickly and aren't replaceable but they're easy to tighten *just right*. I also like boa-style mechanisms and I'm glad to see them on less expensive shoes these days.</div>","author":"Braden Graham","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_713973","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Shimano SPD sandals would be an option then... when it rains get out the goretex oversox.</div>","author":"Robert Clark","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_595481","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Braden the velcro comment is inaccurate and depends on the overall durability of the shoe</div>","author":"Lincs Hcrib","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_643041","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">In general the Mountain bike type , with the recessed pocket for the cleat &amp; a rubber sole..</div>","author":"Robert Clark","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_257732","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">5/10s</div>","author":"Mike Flagler","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_918713","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mike Flagler\"> Adidas Five Ten is also my choice ðŸ˜Š</span></div>","author":"Franziska GÃ¶","gender":"FEMALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_135514","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Franziska GÃ¶\"> yes</span></div>","author":"Mike Flagler","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_514917","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Franziska GÃ¶\"> same here.

We ride mostly in warm weather so I look for a mesh forefoot area.  I am not a fan of the BOA laces because you have to yank that wire quite hard to get the shoe open enough to get them on and off.  I wear Shimano sandals with SPD cleats for touring because if it rains or is muddy a quick rinse and they are ready for the next day.  They are also comfortable for walking around but they can be a bit loose in the forefoot area which makes it more of a twist to disengage from the cleat.  They only make the sandals in  unisex sizes which seems too wide the the forefoot area for a womanâ€™s foot.</div>","author":"Mary Ann Latzgo Padglick","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_354606","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mary Ann Latzgo Padglick\"> depends on the shoe</span></div>","author":"Andy McMahon","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_741998","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">If they ever get these in stock, I plan to order a pair.
