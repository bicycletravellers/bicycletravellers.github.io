There is also the question of longevity and durability. If you are planning on relatively short trips in warm climates then go for a UL tent. If you are planning on longer trips where you need to have some durability choose a tent that offers that. If you are travelling in cold weather and high winds then you need a different tent that can handle that. I live and tour in Iceland, where the weather is cold and high windgusts are frequent and I made an investment in my tent as I plan to use it for hopefully the foreseeable future. My choice was a Hilleberg Soulo. A bombproof tent that keeps me warm, safe, dry and sheltered from the elements. It is also durable so I can count on being able to use it for a number of years. So even with the initial cost being high, then I hope that I do not have to make multiple tent purchases in the future. Many RTW travellers are choosing various Hilleberg models as their go to tents for their durability and how well built they are. Their drawback however is that they are not the lightest tents out there. My Soulo is 2,4kg, but again, its a 4 season tent. A 2person Hilleberg Allak which is a similar design as the Soulo is 3,3kg. Their lightest 2person models are 3season tents and their weights are around the 1,5kg mark. Their lightest solo tent is the Enan, which is 1,2kg. But again, its a 3season tent.</div>","author":"Andri Freyr Sigur√∞sson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_833257","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Andri Freyr Sigur√∞sson\"> I'm gonna take a look into this because the UL tents I see sometimes seem less durable which is a concern for me.
