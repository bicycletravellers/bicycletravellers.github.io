Larger full colour screen than everything else on the market. Helps the old eyes see the map better than the other offerings out there. Garmin also allows you to upload OS maps unlike the rivals where you are stuck with a very limited pre loaded map. Which is kinda important if you plan on going offroad away from urban areas as often you find the trail you are on isnt on the map... This in my view is where the wahoo falls down, the mapping is not very great once you are out of towns and cities and into the wilderness.

The bolt has maps built in where as I needed to get so maps loaded as an extra on the etrex ( you might be able to load up open source ones). The bolt refresh rate is great ( the etrex can lag a bit). Battery pretty good. A plus for me is turn by turn with the bolt if you link to komoot and have the region your travelling unlocked. Love the fact that the etrex uses AA and is great for multi sport but the screen is pretty small and can be a difficult when your trying to see a large area in detail. Both are dead easy to load with routes with some mapping app, i use komoot and plotaroute. I used the etrex as my only bike computer for ages (the bike mount is pretty crap though) until wanting something that's a tad easier to use and fancied turn by turn. On thing that was a bit of a bugbear was the screen on the etrex doesn't  auto rotate where as the bolt always aligns the map to your direction. That said will be off on a 5 day trip soon and will be taking both!!</span></div>","author":"Ian Shuttleworth","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_760325","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Terry Merry\"> Yep, hiking is partly the point; I'm using it for everything else: hiking, kayaking, sailing...

Don't get me wrong, I am not dissing the cycling ones - ideally, I'd have a Bolt or something like that for day rides, and a handheld for tours and other outdoor stuff, but if you want to have only one device that can do both, that's a handheld. Besides, I hardly ever use a GPS on day rides - I know local roads, within a 50-mile radius, well enough. If I do get lost, I can get the phone out. And I prefer riding without a computer always in sight - I'm doing it for pleasure, not performance.
