One can get top quality with almost any 2nd hand product at an often much lower price than by a new one of lower to medium quality. When my dealer had to move to a place with less space, the surplus stock was sold at a 50% discount. So I bought the last cross bike at 1800 instead of 3600$, although I had already one, although from 2010 with less modern equipment (rim brakes etc.). My idea was to resell it with a small profit if I not wanting to keep it. But I would not renounce now...</span></div>",

By Touring Bike general speaking is mainly for asphalt roads then a Trek 520 is your reference to get or similar. It could be that you want to go mainly on dirt roads self-supported then a Surly ECR is your reference to get or similar. You can also get an MTB with eyelets for a rear rack like Marlin from Trek or X-caliber and go on any surface confident to have an excellent Bike (MTBs are made for abuse and Trek welding technology is a the top of the game). You can get second-hand the marlin for under 500 bucks and the x calibre for under a grand (both are 29\" and you can fit up to 2.3 inches tires). if you want to spend under 250 then a Trek MTB 26\" like 4100 will do the trick.  (i made over 10,000 km on a Trek 4100). The Bike in the pic below is a Trek X-caliber 9, an amazing drivetrain, light and right now it has 29\" 2.3 Tyres.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/recommendations-for-a-quality-not-to-break-the-bank-touring-bicycle/image_1655148047.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>",

We have had ours for 25 years and they are still going well. \nWe have in the last five years bought Bromptons which are perfect for long trips. Easy to put on trains to reach the starting point and then easy to make a return journey. No need to worry about packing cases as one does with tourers as long as you have a soft bag for putting them in for train journeys, it’s easy. The bags  fold easily and fit into a small pocket behind the saddle. With a front pannier each, we find we can easily carry what we need for a month of touring. If you were wild camping you’d probably need a rear pannier too. There are masses of inspiring photos and lots of advice on the Brompton Touring  site. \nGood luck</div>",

So far as the bicycle, anything will work, providing it's mechanically okay, has reasonable tyres &amp; is set up suitably for your height/legs... I recently had a guest via the warmshowers website, it was his first tour, riding Paris to Glasgow, on a 40-year-old steel-frame road bike, with skinny 23c tyres &amp; just a 5-speed cassette, the one thing that kept him going, determination.\nFor cooking I originally used a low-cost gas stove, a £15 tent &amp; £25 sleeping bag...the rest, as they say, is history. \nA pic from my first tour (Le Havre to Barcelona)</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/recommendations-for-a-quality-not-to-break-the-bank-touring-bicycle/image_1655148101.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>",

I tried off-road riding, didn’t like it, then became a cycle tourer by adding a rear rack and panniers (oh and road tyres; Continental or Schwalbe Marathon are good). This setup served me well in Scotland for 10 years.\nThe only problem was that the frame was a bit too small so I added long end bars so I could stretch out more.\nGot the original bike in a sale for £250 new (add 20 years of inflation to this).\nPoint is, you can do tours in Europe / N America on any bike with low gears and a system for carrying luggage.\nNow I have a Salsa Marrakech with a Rohloff hub: expensive but after 15 years I knew what I wanted in a touring bike so it’s worth it.</div>",

As such the multiple gearing on the bicycle should allow you a low of 20 gear inches or less.  A good touring bike should allow you approximately 20 to 100 gear inches for riding.\n\nThe formula for gear inches (GI) is as follows: \n\nThe number of gear teeth in front [t(f)] \n\ndivided by the number of teeth in the rear [t(r)]\n\ntimes the outer diameter (D) of the drive wheel in inches.  (1 inch = 25.4 millimetres).\n\nIn equation form:\n\nt(f) / t(r) ×  D = GI.\n\nFor better info on bicycle gearing (including a gear calculator), I proffer this link:\n\n  <a href=\"https://www.sheldonbrown.com/bicycleGears.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.sheldonbrown.com/bicycleGears.html</a>\n\nGood luck in finding the touring bicycle fit for you.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sheldonbrown.com%2FbicycleGears.html&amp;h=AT20WK9TslrluGGXWdhuVaidO6kS9WJEADT_UltlKz45EHUBLVZJ9ojDKrQAl64npyxQ_xK4bTbGqrf4DNdDhmvv-yfjkgkfQzqKbDX1UNZyds1N371UbEYfik1quDYTucEHEw_bbvq4qL4&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn-0.sheldonbrown.com/images/harris-banner.png\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Articles about Gears and Drivetrains</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">sheldonbrown.com</span></a></div></div>",
