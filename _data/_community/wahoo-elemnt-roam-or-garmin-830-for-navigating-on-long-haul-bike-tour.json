We are not interested in tracking what we did or how fast. Just how to get from A to B safely along scenic routes.   Insights and advice please.  Some background  We are currently in Europe for Northern Hemisphere summer.   Thus far we have used our android phones with OSMAnd.  I fried my phone on arrival in Madrid navigating from the airport in the hot sun. As a result my phone is pretty stuffed, in that it can't find gps or connect to wifi. OSMAnd still works for calculating routes etc.  It has found some great routes but also some impassable ones . Our paper michelin maps are pretty useful for finding smaller roads but not any use for finding bike paths or navigating in cities.  \n\nMy questions are: \nwhat maps come with these devices? Are they free? \nhow do others plan routes ? What apps do others use for planning routes Europe .\nHow easy is it to transfer routes from a phone to the device?\nHow obvious is it when you go off route?\nThanks in advance.</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_585547","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_232311","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Hammerhead Karoo 2</div>","author":"Will Taylor","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_778044","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Hi.

You can plan or pickup routes in any of these apps in you phone and send it to your device.
