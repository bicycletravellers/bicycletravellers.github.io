Normally about a hundred quid, but you can find an LBS able to do a basic fit from about 40.\nOr you can Google for tips on the basics.\nIt's quite possible that the saddle height is wrong, which strains your ankles.\nBut other than that, 110k if you're relatively new to it is no mean feat. Some soreness is only to be expected. You need to do the fit anyway, with or without external help, but see if the issue persists - it may go away once you get used to it.\nLonger-term, clipless pedals are a lot more efficient, and despite what laypeople think, safer. If you're into bikepacking, probably SPD - they afford you to walk a bit in the same shoes, i.e., when having to push the bike. You can squeeze pedals  and shoes into 100 quid.</div>","author":"Pavel Bogolyubov","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_370722","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Pavel Bogolyubov\"> thanks for the reply üëç</span></div>","author":"Peter Lownie","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_376572","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Hi Pavel how are you?

And having a foot slipping off can unsaddle you and/or result in a significant kick up the groin with the saddle.\nPeople often feel apprehensive about not being able to clip out when needed, but it's all a matter of habit. Just get into the habit of twisting the foot first, not yanking it, and it'll become second nature. I also clip one foot out a few seconds in advance if I know I'll need to stop, e.g., at traffic lights.\n\nThere's also the fact that if you do end up tumbling over, it's safer to do it still attached to the bike: it'll take some of the brunt. Yes, a lot of people would sustain a personal injury rather than have their bike scratched, but that's just naive. As any outdoor instructor worth their salt would put it, you protect the person first, and then the kit.\n\nBut as a whole, in 20+ years of riding on clipless, I've never - literally not once - have tumbled over because of being clipped in. For other reasons, yes, a few times, but not this.</span></div>","author":"Pavel Bogolyubov","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_291329","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Cheers Pavel, that‚Äôs really convinced me to use clipless on my commute!</div>","author":"Robbie Cryer","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_875807","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I get pain in my right Achilles.

Try a foot roller and also a foam roller or lacross ball on your calves. Achilles is hard to stretch / could also be bursitis.
