I work roughly 5 months a year as a tour leader on international tours around the globe. And then I travel the world for fun the rest of the year. I have worked with this in 40 different countries so far. Liechtenstein will be my country #41 to have worked in this year. Between my tours I go tour cycling or hiking around the parts of the world where I have just worked, or will work next. All that I need, in order to live this lifestyle is to be online for 20-30 minutes every morning and answer work related e-mails. So O am cycling with a small Macbook Air. I like the combination of staying in nice hotels and eating in nice restaurants when I work. And then when I am not working I live  more simple life in small pensions. I am writing these lines from Ravello, by the Amalfi coast, where I just got back from a 10 hour hike in the mountains. My native Denmark, London and Istanbul will be my next destinations.

Very rarely ate out but did depend on country ie Ecuador was almost cheaper to eat out then buy in the suoer market. When you wild camp and eat very basic foods you can live on next to nothing but as with everything there comes high cost items like bike parts, repairs, clothes and beer. Just like with cycle touring you can carry huge amounts of gear or hardly anything, you can have a very cheap second hand bike or a all bells and whistles bike. The same goes for food you can live off of beans, rice and even pick from nature but the most important key is to make it fun and not a chore.

I was questioned at a US border what countries I had been through. I named 40 countries which was followed by \"what do you do for a living? And how can you afford to go to 40 countries?\" On reflection if you travelled to 40 countries separately with insurance, flights, baggage costs, other travel costs you could average ¬£1000 per country give or take. As a couple over 2 years we spent ¬£14000 so 3500 per year per person but then travelling on my own costs increased slightly because its cheaper to cook for 2 then 1 (cost per head) and rooms for 1 aren't much cheaper then fir 2. As I've mentioned you need to allow for the unforseen.

Sometimes I stay in one place 3 weeks or even 3 months. Just got back to my \"base\" in Berlin after 5.5 months in Mexico, where I only did some 2.600 km. I'm always looking for a new client or two. I translate (FR/EN/ES/JP/DE into EN or ES) and I teach Spanish and English via Skype. So my daily routine might be: cycling from wherever I camped for a couple of hours (maybe 3-4 hours?) and then stop at some cafe or restaurant along the road, work online or muck around, or maybe cycle longer and then take a long break under some shade in a park (maybe use my own internet/sim card connection), dry out my gear, take a nap, etc, and in the late afternoon/evening bike another 2-3 hour and find the next camping spot. Recently, though, because of Covid, my business/work has gone down, by 75%!!! So fortunately I am subsisting on the social security benefits (one advantage of growing old, LOL) which almost make up my meager budget. As a cycling nomad you normally don't have great needs, and I've always been a minimalist anyway. So all these years my monthly budget has been between 360 and more recently 450 EUR/month. So basically I can get by on 12-14 EUR per day. And that actually includes the occasional flight, bikes, repairs, clothing (ha ha, maybe 50 EUR a year!), electronics, food and accommodation. 2021 was Portugal, Spain (by bus), France, Germany, Poland and Mexico. 2020 might be Mexico, Germany, Spain, Morocco (or Japan). Now I'm looking to find/create a nomad base for myself and maybe with others (like a cooperative) on the coast between Conil and Tarifa (Cadiz, Spain). Something that 5-6 fellow nomads will take care of while the other 5-6 nomads are away.
