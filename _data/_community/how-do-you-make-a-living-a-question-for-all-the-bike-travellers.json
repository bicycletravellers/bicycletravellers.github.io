Liechtenstein will be my country #41 to have worked in this year. <b>Between my tours, I go tour cycling or hiking around the parts of the world where I have just worked, or will work next.</b> All that I need, in order to live this lifestyle, is to be online for 20-30 minutes every morning and answer work-related e-mails. So I am cycling with a small Macbook Air. I like the combination of staying in nice hotels and eating in nice restaurants when I work. And then when I am not working I live a more simple life in small motels. I am writing these lines from Ravello, by the Amalfi coast, where I just got back from a 10-hour hike in the mountains. My native Denmark, London and Istanbul will be my next destinations. And either my bike or my hiking boots will travel with me on all trips.</div>",

We worked on £10 a day but had a back of double for more expensive places. We camped 90% of the time. Very rarely ate out but did depend on the country ie Ecuador was almost cheaper to eat out than buy in the supermarket. When you wild camp and eat very basic foods you can live on next to nothing but as with everything there come high-cost items like bike parts, repairs, clothes and beer. Just like with cycle touring you can carry huge amounts of gear or hardly anything, you can have a very cheap second-hand bike or a bells and whistles bike. The same goes for the food you can live off of beans, rice and even pick from nature but the most important key is to make it fun and not a chore.&nbsp;</div>",

I was questioned at a US border about what countries I had been through. I named 40 countries which was followed by <b>\"what do you do for a living? And how can you afford to go to 40 countries?\"</b> On reflection, if you travelled to 40 countries separately with insurance, flights, baggage costs, and other travel costs you could average £1000 per country give or take. As a couple over 2 years, we spent £14000 so 3500 per year per person but then travelling on my own costs increased slightly because it's cheaper to cook for 2 than 1 (cost per head) and rooms for 1 aren't much cheaper than for 2. As I've mentioned you need to allow for the unforeseen. Ie tyres rim splitting, frames snapping, warranty exchanges and needing to wait in accommodation for them to arrive and your bike being stolen all of which happened to us.</span></div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"comment_text\">I've been cycling around the world (not one continuous line, though) for some 11 years now, about 48.000 km, some 38 countries. Sometimes I stay in one place for 3 weeks or even 3 months. Just got back to my \"base\" in Berlin after 5.5 months in Mexico, where I only did some 2.600 km. I'm always looking for a new client or two. I translate (FR/EN/ES/JP/DE into EN or ES) and I teach Spanish and English via Skype. <b>So my daily routine might be: cycling from wherever I camped for a couple of hours (maybe 3-4 hours?) and then stop at some cafe or restaurant along the road, work online or muck around, or maybe cycle longer and then take a long break under some shade in a park (maybe use my own internet/sim card connection), dry out my gear, take a nap, etc, and in the late afternoon/evening bike another 2-3 hour and find the next camping spot.</b> Recently, though, because of Covid, my business/work has gone down, by 75%!!! So fortunately I am subsisting on the social security benefits (one advantage of growing old, LOL) which almost make up my meagre budget. <b>As a cycling nomad, you normally don't have great needs, and I've always been a minimalist anyway.</b> So all these years my monthly budget has been between 360 and more recently 450 EUR/month. So basically I can get by on 12-14 EUR per day. And that actually includes the occasional flight, bikes, repairs, clothing (<b>haha, maybe 50 EUR a year!</b>), electronics, food and accommodation. 2021 was Portugal, Spain (by bus), France, Germany, Poland and Mexico. 2020 might be Mexico, Germany, Spain, Morocco (or Japan). Now I'm looking to find/create a nomad base for myself and maybe with others (like a cooperative) on the coast between Conil and Tarifa (Cadiz, Spain). Something that 5-6 fellow nomads will take care of while the other 5-6 nomads are away. Is anyone interested?</div>",

All I need is a basic internet connection. \n\nAnd the best part is that I can fully automate it so that eventually it works for me, even when I'm cycling or sleeping at night.</b> I'm not quite there yet, but I'm in the right direction.\n\nBasically, it's affiliate marketing: I sell other people's products and make a commission on the sales. It allows me to work at my own pace, without having to manage the demands of clients or a boss. It's really great and I've been travelling for 9 months, working from everywhere on my way.\n\nIf you want, I can give you access to free training that explains in detail how it works. I think you might be interested in it at this point in your research. Just let me know in the comments and I'll send it to you.\n\nI wish you good luck in your endeavours. It's really great to be able to just live on your bike!</span></div>",
