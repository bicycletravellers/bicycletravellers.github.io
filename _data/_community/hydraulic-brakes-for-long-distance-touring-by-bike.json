The reason a lot of people use mechanical brakes for touring is that it is nearly impossible to fix serious problems with hydraulic brakes in the field.  Brake bleeds are hard enough when you have a shop with all the necessary tools.  Not to mention parts and even fluid aren't interchangeable. (Some brakes use mineral oil and other side DOT fluid.)\n\n2. On the other hand, I have had hydraulic brakes on all my mountain bikes riding serious downhill on pretty rough terrain with lots of big crashes.  And not once in nearly two decades of abusing my hydraulic brakes have they ever failed and needed to be repaired. I end up bleeding once a year and swapping the pads twice a year, and rotors every other year. \n\nI currently have mechanical brakes on my touring setup because of the service issue, but I am considering swapping to hydraulic for the better stopping power with a loaded bike.  The fact is there are a lot of parts on a bike that are not readily available in remote places, and that isn't really a good enough reason not to use those parts if they work better for you.</div>","author":"Timothy Faust","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_440516","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Timothy Faust\"> Yeah.
