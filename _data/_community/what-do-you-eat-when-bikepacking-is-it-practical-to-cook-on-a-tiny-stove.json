Some cheap ones (and even expensive) can be more an ‚Äúon/off‚Äù - they‚Äôre more for just water. I do combine the benefits of an MSR 1L pot (water, soups) with a pan-style with lid - I find this very versatile, as it provides a skillet/lid and a shallow saucepan. This alone breaks you out of the ‚Äúonly boil water‚Äù world. I‚Äôve even been able to steam tamales that I bought earlier from a street vendor. Once you know you have a range of preparation methods, your opportunities open up.\n\nthe perfect condition is where you can get food daily. There really isn‚Äôt anything you can‚Äôt cook. But, if it‚Äôs a couple/few nights, then pack accordingly. There is always rice/pasta, I came across orzo and like that a lot as a base for a lot of things. The simplicity of packets (not cans) of cooked meats (tuna, chicken, pork) are easy to add in. I always like to carry some vegetables that can double for quick-grab munchies or add-in for a stir-fry (snap peas, broccoli, celery are my faves). Farm-fresh eggs don‚Äôt need refrigeration, so another source of protein. Bring a hard cheese - sauces are creamier and EZPZ cheese quesadilla (add chicken!). Gosh - the possibilities are endless.</div>","author":"Hank Rowe","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_423733","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Hank Rowe\"> thanks that‚Äôs really encouraging, if we start with the right equipment it looks like we can eat very well!</span></div>","author":"Sue McIntyre","gender":"FEMALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_312541","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Sue McIntyre\"> you absolutely can.
