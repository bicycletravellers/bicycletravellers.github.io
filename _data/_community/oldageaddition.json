Back to Australia for family then left for England on the1st Jun do the west to east coast, then time with Aussie friend who had family there and then onto Wales for a few weeks and then on to Ireland meet some people from Australia and court up with them again a few times. Off to Europe and did some house sitting in France, spent pretty well 3 months and solo and tenting most of it. It was awesome but slowly the weather was getting colder and my solo self had sort of run out. Companionship was pretty well missing by the end. Back to England for 4 weeks then off with my sister to Morocco, Portugal and back to France, left sis in Switzerland snow skiing while I headed back to England and return to Australia. Back to Australia and purchased a caravan as my 4x4 was in Newcastle and waited for sis to come and then we set off to drive back to Darwin. Trip of a life time told the kids I was taking a gap year. Did 2,395 + klm and camped alot of the time. That was 2018 what a year and I still have to pinch myself every day. 62 now and still would love to do it all again, still solo so probably will be doing it solo again.

(GAP/C&amp;O, Katy Trail, Cowboy Trail, and many others) Great thing about retirement is that you have time to train and learn how to recover more effectively. I continue to get stronger each year - trips now average 80 miles per day, and range up to 100 miles in a day.  For me it works. It all depends on your goals.
