Personally I would get a free standing tent, unless you know you will always be pitching on soft ground. \nI would also look at the internal height of the tent, as a taller tent will allow you to sit up, and it will also give you more space above your feet and head when you lie down, because the end slopes are steeper.\nSome tents have a separate spreader bar in the middle of tent. This pushes out the walls and makes them more vertical, this will give you a lot more elbow room, especially if there are two of you. \nLook for tents with two entrances. Side entry is easier, and it allows each of you to get out of the tent for a pee at night, without having to climb over the other person. Often these tents will have two vestibules, which is great for storage or cooking in the rain.\nMost of the common tents have reviews on Youtube, which could save some regrets later.</div>","author":"Mark Perry","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_143496","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/two-person-camping-tents-any-advice/image_1655202807.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Per-Erik Sleipner","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_659122","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Per-Erik Sleipner\"> Hi what tent is this?</span></div>","author":"Blandine Stucklin","gender":"FEMALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_472142","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Blandine Stucklin\"> TOG Weekend\n<a href=\"https://packraft-sverige.com/produkt/tog-viken-2-man-4-season-tent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://packraft-sverige.com/produkt/tog-viken-2-man-4-season-tent/</a></span></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpackraft-sverige.com%2Fprodukt%2Ftog-viken-2-man-4-season-tent%2F&amp;h=AT2VRibT7zjmo8nNyQnFiLHcDwmB1RhzPxtwmTMId9fFg5okO9X_QQ0SzXtA_00Bz7tHCNicZQQNbcep_c5cyzUNbZFRJ0qVPM7-WtM1km5bfRtLez9v6Zwuc7nWrCUk3JRXhGkieQgejRk&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://packraft-sverige.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC_0066-sharpen-stabilize.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">TOG Viken - 2 man / 4 season tent</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">packraft-sverige.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Per-Erik Sleipner","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_877207","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Thank you.</div>","author":"Blandine Stucklin","gender":"FEMALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_503927","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Naturehike cloud up 2 , really good, very good price and light.
