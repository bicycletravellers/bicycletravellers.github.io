I've bought a lot of Alpkit gear all great quality and price . I bought the Aeronaut 1 and it was well made and a fantastic price but .... The picture shows what happened when it rained . Because it has two poles at the foot end it collected water. If it had one pole it would form a ridge and water would run off . To me it's a bad design . Alpkit gave me a full refund . I'm generally super impressed with the company but not with this tent. I bought a Vango F10 helium 2 instead .</span></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/inflatable-tents-for-bikepacking-touring/image_1657889176_3078170574.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Peter Couttie","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_634657","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">1 vote for the Soloist here.

It's good . Had up in rain and wind . All seems pretty sturdy. Not as compact as the aeronaut but it's a 2 man and you are only talking a few centimetres difference . Very easy to pitch ( all in one ) and packing is made very easy with the bag rather than the stuff sack. If packing away wet I'd separate the inner and but it in it's own bag before packing together to keep it dry . Ideal for one person . Love the two doors . Cook on either side if wind / rain changes direction . Also lets more air in on warm nights . No condensation issues yet ! If you keep poles separate you can really reduce pack size . So far 10/10 but haven't fully tested .</span></div>","author":"Peter Couttie","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_379489","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Chris Roberts\"> I also have the footprint ground sheet.
