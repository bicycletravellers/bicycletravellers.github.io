The issue is the way you have to get in and out from the top only. \n\nSnugpak Stratosphere is durable and again fairly large hooped bivvy but with the benefit of a side opening that goes 3/4 of the way down. Much easier to get in/out of but if you don't leave the vents fully open condensation can be an issue.\n\nThe best for me is a Snugpak Ionosphere which is basically between a tent/bivvy. Very spacious yet stealthy. Zero condensation in my experience.\n\nI have both Ionosphere and Stratosphere and both have worked well for me. I'll pop a couple of pics up so you can see.\n\nOthers have mentioned Dutch army bivvy bags and while they are great they can be very warm in the summer. Gore Tex is quite thick. Rab eVent material in my opinion is as breathable as Gore Tex but is lighter so not as hot in the heat... Rab Ridge Raider costs twice as much as most bivvy bags though.</div>","author":"Barrett Allen","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_925465","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Ionosphere</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/bivvy-bags-hooped-non-hooped-for-bikepacking/image_1657885341_6081018781.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Barrett Allen","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_688921","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Stratosphere</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/bivvy-bags-hooped-non-hooped-for-bikepacking/image_1657885341_5190823708.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Barrett Allen","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_878940","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Ionosphere entrance</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/bivvy-bags-hooped-non-hooped-for-bikepacking/image_1657885341_4952799535.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Barrett Allen","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_81693","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Ionosphere without the flysheet.
