Voivodina in Serbia. As for Croatia, if you take smaller roads it will not be too busy and it also depends on your timing. We cycled in june through the velebit national park to the coast and saw noone (but many dead frogs for some reason). Kotor is indeed touristy but is definitely stunning, and again here, as soon as you go off the beaten track you wil encounter noone. For example Crkvice has a very interesting history. Skhodra lake is very beautiful to cycle at the west side of the lake. Good luck! Below what we cycled last year. And the albanian raw fish is just delicious. In tirana, the restaurant fishop is just amazing.

I have been told this just a couple of months ago by knowledgeable people working in the area. If you try and cross you may be arrested, there are police patrols. In any case even if you manage to cross you won't have an entry stamp in your passport which may cause you problems when leaving the country. You must enter N Macedonia at Gllobocica, Debar or  Kjafasan - or miss the country out entirely, and go through eastern Albania and enter Greece at Krystallopigi.\n\nWhere your map shows 28 (I believe this is the Cakor Pass in the Rugova Canyon?) there is also no official border crossing here. However you can get a special permit allowing you to cross into Montenegro or Kosovo at non-official border crossings. At least I hope you can, that's the way I'm planning to cycle myself in September!
