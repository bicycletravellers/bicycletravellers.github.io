I often look at a couple options for where I'll stay that night, like if I only go 50 miles I'll stay here but the next place is another 30 miles then I'll only stay there if I'm feeling real good and making great time that day. But I'm also usually doing a mix of camping and hotels so worst case I can always stealth camp if I really misjudge my ability that day haha</span></div>","author":"Annemarie Lucernoni","gender":"FEMALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_638012","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Annemarie Lucernoni\"> Thank you so much!
