The problem with them being old is that the rubber strap at the top is probably decaying. So I got some SKS rubber straps (the kind used to hold on detachable fenders), and those fit fine - just fold over one end and put a pin / rivet / snap whatever through it so it doesn't pull through.</div>","author":"Leif Warner","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
