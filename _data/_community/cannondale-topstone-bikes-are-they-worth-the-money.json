Is it worth it?\n\n**Hello,\n\nJust comparing these two \"Gravel\" bikes here (Triban Rc120) and wondering why anyone would pay extra $1000 for the topstone 4 base model. \n\nThe two bikes have the exact same disk brakes (promax 330r) , microshift components (r8(2x8) vs 1x10 Advent X. Similar frame geometry and a carbon forks for both. Can just swap out the tires on Triban and save a ton of money.\n\nWhat is the Cannondale providing that makes it way more worth it then the Triban? Is it the frame? I know topstone has 2-4 more mm of clearance (38mm vs 43mm maximums) however that doesnt seem to make it worth the extra $1000. What am I missing here?  Is it really just the brand name factor doubling the price? \n\n[https://www.cannondale.com/en-ca/bikes/road/gravel/topstone-alloy/topstone-4](https://www.cannondale.com/en-ca/bikes/road/gravel/topstone-alloy/topstone-4)\n[https://www.decathlon.ca/en/endurance-road-bikes/326838-81472-rc120-disc-brake-bike.html](https://www.decathlon.ca/en/endurance-road-bikes/326838-81472-rc120-disc-brake-bike.html)\n[https://www.decathlon.com/products/gravel-bike-bicycle](https://www.decathlon.com/products/gravel-bike-bicycle)\n\nThanks!<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.decathlon.com/products/gravel-bike-bicycle\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1330/6287/products/TRIBANGRVL120_10_grande.jpg?v=1631636128\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Triban GRVL120, Disc Microshift Gravel Bike</div><p class=\"link-tool__description\">Designed For Discovering Gravel Riding, The Grvl120 Is Simple And Versatile.

I converted both to reflect a standard measurement.\n\nDisregarding that, I explained the major differences, without going into weight (which is irrelevant) and wheelsets. The Triban, also, appears out of stock. So good luck getting one.\n\nFor the same price of the Cannondale, you can buy an RC520, which has shimano 105 and spyre TRPs, it blows that cannondale out of the water any day.</span></div>","author":"James Cupp","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_785264","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"James Cupp\"> I have both bikes with the same set of brakes.hundred km so far with Triban and 1700km on cannondale: me and my buddy traded bikes, we both stop on a dime with the pro max 300r single piston brakes with 0 issues 😛 youve still been helpful though I appreciate the price difference</span></div>","author":"Steven Kazavchinski","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_347773","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Steven Kazavchinski\"> Steven Kazavchinski  I mean they will stop, sure. Anything will stop, but it still doesnt chamge the fact that thw actual braking surface is the size of your thumb, if that.\n\nIm speaking to you as a courier, someone who races CX, technician and a sales rep. Brakes would be my first upgrade, more braking surface means more braking power.\n\nHowever on a flip side, standard for CX is only 33, so braking power doesnt mean much if your tires are slipping in mud, sand or snow, but the difference is that its a sure fire first time every time. Really, thats my only complaint with both bikes, entry level brakes.\n\nIf both prices shown on the site are CAD, then youre getting robbed.</span></div>","author":"James Cupp","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_718186","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I really liked the Cannondale Topstone Leftie I auditioned.
