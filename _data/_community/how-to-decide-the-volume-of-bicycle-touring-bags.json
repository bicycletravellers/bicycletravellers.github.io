Keep in mind, that you always find a place to wash your clothes. I have two VAUDE environment-friendly aqua back panniers - with two smaller outer pockets. They have 25 l each, a Silkroad bag (on the rear rack), but only because of my medicines and because I am a woman. I also will have a handlebar bag. Last year I had a 30 l big bag on the rack for my winter coat, which was too clumsy for me - maybe it would be suitable for the tent, mattress etc.\n\n1 pic = last year, 2 pics = this year</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-to-decide-the-volume-of-bicycle-touring-bags/image_1655128874.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>",
