You can hit maintenance, weather, or amazement along the way and spend two or three days where you didn’t plan to. Best advice, for every three days of riding plan a rest day. For every two rest days plan a break day. Then plan at least two days on the back end before you have to be back for work or responsibilities. This way, if you break along the route you have plenty of time to make up. Or you can ditch your bike, bus home, grab a car, recover your bike, and plan for your next trek with a better idea of what could happen.
