Carbon (good carbon) is much stronger than most alloy bars. Take rims for example. Aluminum alloy rims get dented and bent easily and often. Carbon rims can take far more abuse than aluminum without deforming. That said under ‚Äúsevere‚Äù impact or loads they can fail, but it‚Äôs way higher than their use permitters. In other words if you get in an accident with a car, yeah the bars might break, but‚Ä¶\nAlso, notice how Formula 1 cars are made out of carbon fiber?
