As a head coach of a competitive freestyle team in Colorado, before every season we go to the neurology hospital. The director of surgery prepares a 2 hour PP presentation for the athletes and the parents about BTI full of stats of just how little helmets do at speeds over 20mph. Why? Because extreme sports and even more dangerous when male teens, who have extra self confidence as it is, think they can do anything because the have a helmet, back protector, and knee pads. Yes, they help reduce pain and more serious injury, but if it's you and a tree and more than 20mph, the tree will win and you will likely die but not from head trauma - most skiers die because their chest collapsed from impact.  \n\nIn the summer we have a mountain biking camp - real advance stuff for the advanced kids (downhill in the forests through jumps and other obstacles) that require a motorcycle type helmet and tons of other protective gear. We do the same talk with the same surgeon for them to learn about BTI, concussions, injuries he sees every year, and tons of stats. \n\nThe point is to remind the kids that the required protective gear won't save their life or prevent concussions (5 concussions and an athlete 7-18 yo kids) is not allowed to compete anymore. They could end up paralyzed or in a vegetated state if not dead with or without protection. Not wearing a helmet means they can't be on the team or the biking camp. Has it saved lives? Who knows. I've seen a lot of nasty hits with and without helmets in my time. None died so I won't create drama for an effect as if it was the helmet to credit - the human body is a lot stronger than many assume it to be.

Drivers like cyclists wearing helmets because then the driver is then more comfortable taking risks around cyclists and can blame the helmet for failing to protect when it is the motorized vehicle operator who failed to avoid = HIT! A helmet does not increase my SAFETY. It reduces my \"risk\". Unless it doesn't! (Well documented. See link at end.)\n\nI hit the back of a parked pick-up truck (Suffering from heat exhaustion.) Stitches in the chin. Loose tooth. Still. Doctor said helmet would have made no difference. Had there been good bicycle infrastructure the truck would not have been in my path.\n\nI hit a lightweight horizontal plastic beam placed across two tall traffic pylons to prevent oncoming vehicular access to a lane. I had looked down to turn off my headlight because I was going to be running counter-flow to traffic- legally! - and when I looked up I was already upon it. Scared the literal feces out of me and I ended up on the ground. Just my pride hurt and a few experience points on the bike. Again, had there been appropriate infrastructure I would not have hit it because it would not have beam there. (Typo intentional!)\n\nThe third incident involved soft gravel where a rail-trail crossed a road. The rail-trail was bicycle friendly. The gravel, while inappropriate for bicycles, was fine for the \"four-wheelers\" which were more common on the trail. I was fully loaded and went down into what I later learned was poison ivy. It was deep into dusk and I could not see, but gravel is a good buffer, it turns out. Although my rear derailleur has not been the same since.\n\nI am currently wearing a helmet, but only because I discovered that I could buy replacement Velcro to reattach the inside \"net\" to a shell that I have had for over a decade. I will wear it in protest. I am less confident while wearing it because I know that even I, as a cyclist driver, am willing to drive closer to cyclists if they are wearing a helmet than if they are not. Give us decent infrastructure and the need for helmets will almost disappear. If I have a collision with a vehicle I will almost certainly be moving at above 30 km/h. If the vehicle is moving at 30 km/h that makes the impact a 60km/h impact. Besides that, the 100:1 weight ratio makes the outcome a given. I am suffering a 60km/h impact into an immovable object. Simple fact: Helmets state very clearly \"NOT FOR USE ON MOTORIZED VEHICLES\" which is to say, not for use at speeds above 50km/h, probably less even than that.\n\nIf helmets cause drivers to take greater risks around cyclists then the helmet is actually a risk. If drivers give me a larger safety margin because of my naked head, GOOD! Helmet use is wise, but helmet use is also used to shame cyclists and to blame them for injuries sustained due to collisions with VEHICLES! Give us safe bicycle infrastructure where we do not need to interact with vehicles and watch the injury rates disappear.\n\nFor the record, I currently ride with a 70cm fiberglass rod attached to my rear rack such that it protrudes out to my left. (We drive on the right in Canada.) I have streamers and a light attached to the end. And a drill bit. The law in Ontario, Canada, requires that drivers give me 1m of space. Asking cyclists to share infrastructure with motorized vehicles is like asking lambs to share lion cages. No matter how well fed or well behaved the lion is, there is only one possible outcome.\n\nMake it safe. Do it now. No more dead cyclists, whether wearing a helmet or not!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=bicycle+helmets+not+designed+for+motorized+use&amp;oq=bicycle+helmets+not+designed+for+motorized+use&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l2.10529j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.google.com/search?q=bicycle+helmets+not+designed+for+motorized+use&amp;oq=bicycle+helmets+not+designed+for+motorized+use&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l2.10529j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8</a></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dbicycle%2Bhelmets%2Bnot%2Bdesigned%2Bfor%2Bmotorized%2Buse%26oq%3Dbicycle%2Bhelmets%2Bnot%2Bdesigned%2Bfor%2Bmotorized%2Buse%26aqs%3Dchrome..69i57j33i160l2.10529j0j7%26sourceid%3Dchrome%26ie%3DUTF-8&amp;h=AT3d6pxFefvx1Ltr6_mRzMg-tcZS0DkOxeLdIyn4ONpMRH-mZY6jcv7T7zFX59Dl9iG0Q_dC8eAoIrmX8Ycj7FjCDfM-rNJfPmL1iP8ClAn5bgYDUxJfj1QN2caMTaVxkM2aysKu0xbO_oU5tN7WNBLs0cNf3aY3RFY&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/images/branding/googleg/1x/googleg_standard_color_128dp.png\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">bicycle helmets not designed for motorized use - Google Search</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">google.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Peter Lehman","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_923454","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Peter Lehman\"> have you cycled outside Canada/US? I'm currently in Romania. One lane highways with trucks flying in both directions and all I have is the white line. There is no shoulder, especially in the mountains. Sometimes, if lucky, you get 20-40cm shoulder on the flats. I use a mirror. If trucks can't pass me because an oncoming truck is coming, they slow down and wait. Not once has a single truck or car since I started this tour from Istanbul last month, honked in anger. They have been terrific to me and other cyclists unlike the US and Canada where drivers (not truck driver - they seem to be a global group of great  drivers except logging trucks; those drivers are mental) get bent out of shape if they see a bike. I'm from Boulder CO. We have had people intentionally running over groups of cyclists killing a few. We have other assholes that throw thumbtacks or oil on the road in the mountain passes. These also led to a few deaths. \n\nHelmets are rated to a max speed before they are useless. For the ski industry, since I have been on it for years working as a head coach, program director, mountain instructor trainer and product tester for one or my sponsors, I can tell you that POC helmets, being the top of the line manufacture, are rated to 13mph (20kph). The special race once with the ear protectors are rated to 25mph. Our 6 year old racers go much faster than this! For bikes, I do not know the industry standard but I wear POC for both sports because I get them for free. Well, I sometimes wear them, depending on the snow or road conditions. \n\nIt's hilarious that people think a helmet prevented them from getting a concussion. Helmets do not prevent concussions. A hard hit to the head with or without a helmet will jolt the brain enough that it will hit the skull which will result in a concussion. \n\nLiam Nelson's wife died (in Canada) from a fall on a green run. She was barely moving and wore a helmet. The jolt was enough to cause her brain to swell up. They didn't go to the hospital in time to drill a hole in her skull to relieve some pressure and she died. \n\nIn Turkey, I met up a French Canadian family from Montreal. We rode together a few time in Bulgaria and Romania when our paths crossed since they stick to the flats and I like high mountain passes. Kids are the best insurance against drivers. It's incredible how careful ALL drivers become when they see a 9 and 11 year old riding behind dad with mom in a bright vest taking the rear. I've never experienced so many cars and trucks come to a near stop without a single one bitching, honking, or screaming anything negative. When they rode from Canada to FL, that was a different story. They had a lot of Karens telling them off, yelling at them, or screaming. On one asked for their opinion but they sure as hell feel entitled to spill their personal philosophy and expect you to change your ways because they are right and you are wrong. One nut bag even called the police saying they are risking their children's life and growth! Americans have too many nut bags. I feel ashamed being one. Luckily, I'm a duel citizen so around the world I tell most people I'm Israeli unless I'm in a Muslim Arab country…\n\nAttached is a pic of me pulling the 9yo with a special bungee for pulling other cyclists. Pulled her 88.5km in 5:04 hrs to reach our warmshower host before the big 3 day rain storm. Kids helmets are even less protective. But being a kid is enough to scare the daylights out of all drivers. No one wants to be the person to hurt or kill a child. \n\nCountless trucks and cars would just drive very slowly until they could pass. And they would ride as far as they could on the other lane. Some trucks would ride the opposite lane forcing on coming vehicles to slow down. Trucks are bigger. No one wants to play chicken with a truck. When it's truck vs truck, the passing truck flashes lights. Other truck driver understands the message and slows down. I taught the girls to do the \"pull the air horn gesture\" to thank the truck drivers. The drivers LOVE it and sometimes even blow short tunes!</span></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/why-not-wear-a-helmet-when-bike-touring/image_1657864629_4628866833.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Adir Sharon","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_102032","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Peter Lehman\"> I took this photo of the family riding on the border bridge from Bulgaria to Romania.

They waited a few good minutes. And even without doing the air horn gesture, many if not most, would blow their horns to cheer the family on! \n\nPoint is: 1.

No helmet is going to save you in a serious accident, but safe bicycling infrastructure is going to prevent you from getting into a serious accident. Instead of fighting with each other over yes or no helmeting we should be advocating for safe places to ride, for all ages and abilities, so we don't need helmets.</div>","author":"Sjeng Derkx","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_263305","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">For those interested in looking into the issue beyond personal experience, here is some extensive research: <a href=\"http://www.cycle-helmets.com/helmet_statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cycle-helmets.com/helmet_statistics.html</a></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cycle-helmets.com%2Fhelmet_statistics.html&amp;h=AT1S22h0awWeoX6PQiaQNNElHFDDIjksX9FSNa55UB3ose9W5vT8RQwn5ZO4puaLZzeXahihi1esr7ApZG1WiOT69iNTLN_twJS2o-n7l2zBzf6qV84JePUsbli3UlgBdrId63PZmqpxhzFWKDlIz6quAiyXHI3MhGE&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.cycle-helmets.com/imgs/king-county-3.gif\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Bike riding helmets: public health research studies, facts</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">cycle-helmets.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Sjeng Derkx","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_541509","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Our daughter had a surfing accident, broke her cheek bone, which took just weeks to recover, but her concussion took 12 months to recover, not able to work at all for 3 months, part time for about 8 months.
