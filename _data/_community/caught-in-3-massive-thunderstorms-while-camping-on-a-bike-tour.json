Avoid empty fields in a thunderstorm where you are the tallest object.\n\n2. Avoid lone trees, edge of a forest, river banks, or high ridges or above treeline (go as deep inside of a forest as you can. \n\n3. Park bike away from you. It can acts as a lightening rod though the reality is, anything can attract lighting regardless what it's made from. Lightening looks for the nearest object it can reach. If there is nothing, it hits the ground.\n\n4. Not sure this works but I use an extendable metal hiking pole to hold my bike as a kick stand from under the seat. A few times camping above tree line, I fully extended it and stuck it in the ground far from me to act as a lightening rod with the bike in the opposite direction to give the lightening a few different objects besides my tent - this could just be psychological to make me feel safer - I have no science to back it up though I once wanted to invent a special retractable light lightening rod for bike tourers (I'm sure in the future someone with time and money will manufacture it if the market is big enough).\n\n4. Use a tent. Psychologically we feel more secure in it than in a bivvy but more importantly, in a tent, you can isolate better - and not be wet or uncomfortable or as scared - if the storm is close. Sit in the center with shoes on. If you have an air pad even better (the Big Anges I use is 3 inches thick when filled and packs small and light) as it keeps you isolated from the ground should the tent or ground near you get hit it reduces the odds of it jumping on you. \n\n5. Most important: count the seconds between lightening and thunder. Multiple it by the sonic number (342). That will give you the most accurate distance in meters. If 9 seconds or more you are safe - it's 3km away.. If 6 seconds it's getting closer at 2km away. 3 seconds it's 1km away - it's getting dangerous. 1. Second it's 342 meters away but let's just round down to 300 meters, about 1000 feet. Seek proper shelter or follow the previous instructions.\n\nUsually thunderstorms go away as quickly as they come if that's a relief. But the best prevention is preparation. Find a weather app you like/trust and check for thunderstorms. \n\nHere are the \"top 5\": <a href=\"https://www.miops.com/blogs/news/5-best-real-time-lightning-strike-map-apps-and-websites-for-photographers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.miops.com/blogs/news/5-best-real-time-lightning-strike-map-apps-and-websites-for-photographers</a></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.miops.com%2Fblogs%2Fnews%2F5-best-real-time-lightning-strike-map-apps-and-websites-for-photographers&amp;h=AT0fH5wOJQxboTTZtYjcIg8C9gZU3SFCEtuY60_YelpO_K_Fci9d1gpxdYjaXycFqkoJxbVDDzAUPIbEKcTB5pcn_7eCKvLdaV1h8lqTj_cQx8fSjDJgt_aHSgGIdycz8tqYVkvq9ypPKsEa33wbsLToloQGTJ4q8FE&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/3147/0662/articles/emil-jarfelt-NROJUYgpjKE-unsplash_copy_6a161928-a422-4d55-8835-92dab34f9b1e_1200x818.jpg?v=1588067229\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">5 Best Real Time Lightning Strike Map Apps and Websites for Photographers</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">miops.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Adir Sharon","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_671655","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Adir Sharon\"> Adir, there arw thunderstorms during hours above your head these days.
