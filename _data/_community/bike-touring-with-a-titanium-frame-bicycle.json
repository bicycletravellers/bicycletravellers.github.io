I like Ti because on our rides there are many obvious and loud gravel, rock, and stick frame strikes.  Some chain slap too.  None of that bothers me because the frame is immune to damage from those insults.  Frame is a Moots Routt 45.  All respect to the more expensive and lighter Routt RSL, but I prefer the 45 bc its tube walls are thicker.  Doesn’t hurt that the frame’s geometry is spot on in general and for me bc learned from decades of fit experience on other bikes.  It’s not the lightest or fastest bike, but is supremely confident in all situations.
