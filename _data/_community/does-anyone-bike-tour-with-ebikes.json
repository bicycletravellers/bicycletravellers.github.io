But when I ride my acoustic Seven, I have to take it easy on the hills, OR when riding with someone half my age ( which happens twice a week) I use the Ebike.\nI also do not turn on the power until I drop below mph.\nNow I would like to point out that my EB is 50 lbs, very similar to my Seven, loaded for touring.\n\nI'm not a fan of throttles, but doing consulting for a friend on what she should get for an EB, I found that at a certain point she has to stop, lie down &amp; massage her hip, so she can get back home.  She's facing a hip replacemnt at some point.
