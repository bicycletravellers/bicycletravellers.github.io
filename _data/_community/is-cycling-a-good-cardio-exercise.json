They, instead, had me doing a daily PT routine in the gym, which included a full run on the Life-Cycle. After doing the Life Cycle daily, I was able to ramp up  the resistance to an incredible amount during the hill-climbing program. The end result was that at the end of four months, I got back to being able to run again.
