I often ride my SL7 for 8 to 12 hours.  The AL3 is near the bottom of the Domane range so all the comfort feature have not trickeled down, but its very solid.  I has a second hand AL3 for my TACX indoor trainer, whils i ride my SL7  outdoors.  The TACX has a vibration featur to simulate cobble stones, gravell etc.  You hardly feel it on the AL3, but I sure do in my Hardtail MTB!.  You may also wan to note that the Trek Pro team and TreK Segafredo now use the Perelli P-ZERO Race TLR tires and have droped the standard Botranger tires. Again i can testify to how comfortable they are. A new Domane AL3 with take 35C tires. i use the P-Zero 30x700 and wow they are good.  Although the are cales RACE, perelli claim they are an endurance tire and again I can testify to that.  Just note the max wight (combined rider, bike, and baggage ) rating for the AL3 is 125Kg or 275lbs.    I don't know the marlin, and htey dont state a max weight, so I cant compare however it does appear to have more spokes per wheel which may or may not be a good sign)</div>","author":"Julian Young","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_753108","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">The Marin looks more relaxed and comfortable, how much luggage are carrying?
