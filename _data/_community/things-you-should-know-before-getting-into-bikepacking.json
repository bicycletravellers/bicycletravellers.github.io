Always have some emergency food. A couple of tins of fish is ideal as it keeps and has protein. You MUST have protein in emergency food.\n2. Never forget suncream.\n3. If you put on damp shorts or a damp first layer, it'll be dry in ten minutes.\n4. If you wash clothes in a hotel bedroom etc., squeeze out the water, then lay them on a towel. Swissroll the lot and walk barefoot along the towel. That'll have them as dry as you can physically get them, and hang them up. They're usually dry in the morning.\n5. Two Panadol (paracetamol, acetaminophen) just before sleep will give you a better sleep as slight muscle soreness tends to disturb it.\n6. The most memorable things from a tour include talking to ordinary people, having a look into a church etc., taking photos etc. A camera is better than a phone as selfies are a load of rubbish vs a shot taken with a self-timer.\n7. If one side of your backside gets persistently sore, turn the nose of your saddle slightly to that side and see if it helps. It really did for me.\n8. After 30y of cleats I got rid of them due to a torn meniscus and persistent knee pain. The real cure is flat pedals with stiffish soled shoes AND putting the pedal axle under mid-sole rather than forefoot. I'm three years without pain after doing this. You lose NO power.\n9. Carry a bit of canvas which you can put inside a smallish tear in the side of a tyre. Called a boot. Won't work if the tear is on the part of the tyre which is on the road. A little bit of glue, or solution will hold it in place.\n10. For commonly accessed allen keys, proper keys are much less fiddly than those on a multitool.\n11. Carry a few links of spare chain AND a chaintool. Also maybe 4 spare spokes for rear wheel, two from each side.\n12. Take it easy. Effortless pedalling will still make you tired. In my early days of touring I used a pulsemeter and had a max pulse beyond which I would not go.\n13. How to climb a big hill. Head off at what seems a modest pace and slow down after 100 yards/metres.\n14. A 5 minute break is very refreshing.\n15. To eat carbs only, as on the bike food, is a mistake. You'll get the knock/bonk easier. Eat a cheese sandwich with not too much bread.\n16. I use two pumps. One short fat one for volume. One slender one for Higher pressure. Combo is excellent.</div>","author":"Gearóid Ó Laoi","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_43784","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Gearóid Ó Laoi\"> great advice thanks</span></div>","author":"Debra Baum","gender":"FEMALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_893617","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Gearóid Ó Laoi\"> thanks: that is great advice.
