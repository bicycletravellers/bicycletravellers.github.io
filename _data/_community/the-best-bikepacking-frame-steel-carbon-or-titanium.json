You can fix that with nice carbon wheels and running tubeless, but then it isn't cheap anymore. \n\nSteel can mean a lot of different things.  There is good steel and cheap steel, and everything ok between. Colnago and Walmart both make steel frames, but they are hardly comparable.  Steel can have a much more compliant ride than aluminum or titanium, and a good steel frame doesn't weigh much more. But a good steel frame isn't cheap either. A weird property of steel is that it is the least strong material to build a bike out of, but the most durable. Per ounce, steel is about 1/10th as strong as carbon, however a crash that would destroy a carbon frame might just put a solely cosmetic dent in steel. It's also one of the least efficient materials to build a bike out of, but for most people compliance is more important than efficiency.</div>","author":"Timothy Faust","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_840183","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Timothy Faust\"> what's the expiration date on carbon?</span></div>","author":"Trey Freeman","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_37591","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Timothy Faust\"> lots.of nonsense unfortunately.</span></div>","author":"Alan Cole","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_366799","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Timothy Faust\"> what do you mean with steel is the least strong material?

Steel because assuming it's decent quality and made well (and neither is hard to do) it rides nice and will out live you, your grand kids and their childrens children...unless they get hit by anything bigger than a garbage truck. Titanium is a different animal, again, made right and with good tubes, it's a great ride, but lighter and more nimble. Not as forgiving as steel, and not as fixable but less fragile than aluminum (stress cracks) or carbon.</div>","author":"Justin Serpico","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_419013","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Justin\">, the material is pretty  much irrelevant  to ride feel compared to seat post design and tyre size/pressures with design and workmanship being key what makes it last. \n\nTitanium may be strong,  but the welds are the weak point and very hard to do well.
