They are in it fir the chase. I had hundreds of occasions where I was faced with very aggressive dogs and just stopping seemed to defuse the attacks. Then move off slowly. I also used a Y shaped stick as a bike stand and piece of innertube to hold the front brake on. This had many uses. 1 to stand the bike up 2 to fend off dogs  and 3 by putting it side ways on the rear rack with a flag or yellow vest it helped to keep vehicles from coming to close. You can just seen the stick in the photo. To note we never had to hit anything or even pull out from the rack but just gave us a piece of mind.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-to-deal-with-dog-bite-when-cycle-touring/image_1655217302_9339587614.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Tim Bridgman","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_4642","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Tim Bridgman\"> totally agree.

The noise of a bike, stakeboard, etc, triggers them. Chasing is their way of running you out of their personal space/territory. If you can stop, put yourself between the dog and the bike, do that. Get loud but not aggressively screaming - they will sense the fear. Don't make direct eye contact. Look left and right - with your head, not just the eyes and use a more calm and deeper voice to ease them. This usually diffuses most of them letting them know you aren't challenging them. Direct eye contact, as most of us already know, is seen as a challenge. \n\nDogs typically attack (an attack is more than a nip/bite at your lower legs - it's multiple charges) as a last resort unless they have an underlying aggression/behavioral issue. A bite at the legs, as scary as it can be, and paibful, is usually confused with but isn't an  aggression. It's an innate herding/territorial behavior. \n\nIf they continue, and/or go for other parts of the body, that's a problem. In that case, throw away all your humanitarian beliefs and fight back if there is no other choice. \n\nAs others have said, a loud airhorn is useful to confusing them and stop them in their track. An emergency whistle works just as well and is much smaller and easier to carry around your neck for quick response. \n\nYou can also use a hiking pole to keep them focused on that (a retractable hiking pole has many other used such as a more reliable and sturdy kick stand for a loaded bike. Hitting an aggressive dog will only make they more mad and agressive. \n\nAs a last resort, on a dog that is showing territorial aggression (one that won't leave you after a nip or after you stop and keeps trying to attack you), and you feel like it will end up even worse for you, use mace. It's uncomfortable (in the military it was used on us a few times in training) but it won't cause them permanent physical harm.\n\nAfter a bite, clean and cover the wound. Find a place to get a rabbies shot even if you recently had one done. Locals will help you with information even if you're in a remote area (except Patagonia, Pamir mountains, etc - which for such remote locations ALWAYS get a rabbies shot before you depart from home) \n\nAlways get rabbits shots before you leave on tour unless the doctor says otherwise based on when you have your last shot.</div>","author":"Adir Sharon","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_281888","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Adir Sharon\"> I hear wasp spray works too.</span></div>","author":"Trey Freeman","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_704356","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Trey Freeman\"> Don't use wasp spray, or any other bug killing spray.

Passing one property x5 dogs from Jack Russells to bigger hunting dogs went nuts. I was riding slowly up hill. Two of the dogs jumped over an 8 feet high fence by climbing on top of an out house. Once they came they all came, barking, growling, snarling after me. I immediately got off my bike and placed it between the dogs and me. A few of the mutts tried to get around my bike but I then shouted at them to go home! A few went but several remained, growling snarling trying to circle and get behind me to bit me. The owner of the property did not come out. They never do. I was scared. If  I had had a gun I would have shot them as loose aggressive dogs are a menace at best and dangerous at worst. Eventually after standing still and shouting aggressively at them to go home and pointing to their property they left, but it was scary. I like dogs but being their dinner is not something I look forward to. I think next tour I take my walking poles so I can beat any dog that does give chase, gets too close and tries to bite me or my panniers. I would use them on owners as well as it is a pretty terrifying experience. I may well try to get some bear spray mace. I suppose you could empty a fuel bottle on them and then chuck a match at them BOOM!! Sorry but it's either them or me.
