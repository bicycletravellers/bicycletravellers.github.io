The logistics to find places, and the likely higher cost, could be an annoying challenge to overcome. Wild camping is very hard in any SEA countries. Almost every inch of land is occupied or too wild to bush whack through. Again, not impossible, but more difficult than Europe or US regardless the legality. \n\nThe biggest challenge will probably be dealing with all the paperwork and various vaccines and govt certificates and official stamps needed to bring a dog into x country. Some might require animal quarantine. Thailand reserves the right to hold your dog up to 30 days if they feel like it. They also want an itinerary of where your dog will be during your trip. Not sure \"on a bike\" will be accepted. Do a Google search for the countries you want to visit. Below is from the zrhsi embassy. It looks pretty intensive.
