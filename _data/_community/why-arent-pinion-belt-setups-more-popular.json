A lesser reason is a bit of neophobia. A third reason is that competition bikes, that I know of,  all use derailleurs and the market follows the trends of competition. \nMost bikes bought in the world are budget bikes and derailleurs are ubiquitous. There are huge economies of scale, and every bike shop in the world can fix them and will probably stock derailleur gear sets. Outside of the cost of the gear systems themselves, pinions also requires a special frame. Additionally if you opt for belt drive, you need a modified chainstay on the drive side.\nOn the subject of neophobia, almost everyone who has ever ridden a bike knows and understands the derailleur type of gearing. There is a similar market reluctance for automatic transmission cars in the UK, which is illogical considering that in other markets automatics are the norm.\nAs for copying competitive teams and what they do, on most bikes you won't be getting the same gear sets, but hey, look at F1. Ultimately I think Rohloff and Pinion sit in the non-competitive niche of touring and will never have the benefits of scale to help them.\n\nAs for me. I would love a Rohloff or Pinion system, with belt drive, but I cannot afford them. Well I could afford them, but for the extra money I can buy a hell of a lot of other gear, or stuff for my family. For the price of a Rohloff hub, you can buy a passable touring bike. Most people when taking up a new pastime buy entry level or mid-priced gear. That is what I did, and unless my bike is destroyed in an accident I can't really justify replacing a perfectly serviceable bike. Now if I was much younger, single, with a good job, (or just had deep pockets) then maybe I could afford to.\n\nJust my 2c.</div>","author":"Mark Perry","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_708287","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mark Perry\"> thanks for very objektive comments. 👍🏼</span></div>","author":"Lars Albæk","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_141610","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mark Perry\"> the neophobia is the biggest reason for most imho, the drawbacks of a derailleur set up are easily taken for granted and the minor drawbacks of a Rohloff/Pinion set up are always blown out of proportion.

Substantially less expensive. Standard parts available everywhere in the world. In decades touring I haven't had many issues with it, and none I couldn't fix, usually by myself or if not usually same day or worst case have to wait a day or so.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind with these esoteric setups is while they may run longer without any maintenance whatsoever, if/when something DOES go wrong, it can be very very difficult to get fixed, and even more so if you are in the middle of nowhere. I haven't met anyone with a Pinion but I have met several Rohloff owners who were completely stranded by a failure and were looking at having to wait for over a month in the middle of Asia while they shipped wheels back to Germany or waited for specialist parts from SJS or Thorn in the UK.\n\nI think with more local touring in developed countries, this factor may not be so important. But even \"at home\" in a developed country a failure is more likely to put your bike out of commission for an extended period, if parts have to be ordered.\n\nI sort of see these things as appealing to people who aren't willing to do the smallest amount of maintenance on their bike, people who just never really got into that whole end of it of being able to look after their own bike. And while a setup like this will lower the maintenance required on the chain, specifically, it won't fix all the other things that can go wrong, broken spokes, cracked saddle rails, frayed gear cables (or whatever with electronic- which probably IS more reliable), broken shifters, new brake pads, buckled wheel, worn out BB, pedal spindle failure, broken fork, crack in frame, worn gritty hubs, cranks coming apart- I mean, just about everything else that can ever go wrong. You still have to deal with all that stuff. This only gets you out of one small little part of it, that very rarely fails anyway. I have NEVER had a chain failure with a chain I put on myself. I once had a failure with a chain adjusted by a shop after I changed chainrings, I think they re-joined it without using the special pin, which you need to with modern chains. So it broke, and I fixed it with my chain tool and a quick link on the side of the road, in about 5 minutes. Less hassle than a puncture. And that's once in decades cycling.\n\nI could also see the point if you were doing particularly mucky cycling, if you were really specializing in horrible muddy off road conditions. The one place I have wrecked a derailleur is racing cyclocross, and while the lack of efficiency with these would rule them out racing, I could see the point there.\n\nFor regular road or gravel riding or touring, it's really just not that difficult to maintain a chain. It does require a certain maintenance schedule, but it's just not that difficult. Main thing is just to wipe the chain occasionally and re-lube it when it starts to get noisy, with the lube I use (Squirt) this is typically every 500-1,000km in dry conditions. Takes 2 minutes, it's really not a problem. Replace chain when it stretches, with modern 11 speed chains this can be up to 10,000km, I have got that long out of them. 10sp on my tourer need new chain typically 3,000-5,000 in mixed conditions.</div>","author":"Ivan McAvinchey","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_437317","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Ivan McAvinchey\"> I’ve travelled the world on bike with derailleur set up because Rohloff or Pinion weren’t available bitd … if I would go again it would definitely be a Rohloff or Pinion.

I contacted them a couple of years ago, asked if they could build one, and as it happens their bike designer had one on a more aggressive trail bike which he brought up to their nearest shop for me to look at (I happened to be visiting the UK). He could get a Broken Road built for me. Covid slowed things down but the bike did arrive. Notice the green gear box - I got the 18 speed and the dropper post shown but not specced (the web photo is actually my bike, their first Broken Road with a Pinion. \n\nMy price worked out to be about US$4500 after I'd paid some duty to get it into Canada. Prices will have increased since then, no doubt.\n\nThe price was awesome: I bought two bikes similarly specced (except my wife's doesn't have a dropper post since she will be using it mainly for bumpy road touring) for about the same price as a custom build locally in Canada. The componentry is not as good as the local bike would have been and I have put carbon wheels on it (only because I scored some on sale, not because I needed them for my sedate riding).\n\nTalk to them.

If you're only going out for a few months' ride and you're not sure that bike touring is going to be a long-term lifestyle thing for you, it doesn't really make sense to spend that much straight off the bat. That said, if bike touring/bikepacking is something you're going to be doing for years to come then I definitely think a Pinion is an excellent investment. \n\nI'd spent just under four years cycling around the world on a regular derailleur drivetrain when I switched to my Pinion C1.12 bike (Tout Terrain Outback Xplore) last year, and having now been on my Pinion for around nine months I think I'd really struggle to go back to a derailleur. The gear range is perfect, the shifting is butter smooth, and it's pretty close to zero maintenance with a belt drive, which is a huge plus especially in very dusty/muddy places - I REALLY don't miss cleaning my chain. I don't notice any extra resistance from the gearbox, and with the weight centred in the bottom bracket, I find it handles better than my old bike even with the extra 1kg or so from the gearbox. Over the course of many years, the costs also do balance out a little as you won't have to replace chains and cassettes nearly so often, and these days those components have become very expensive, at least for higher-end 11 and 12-speed drivetrains. I wouldn't tell a newbie tourer, or someone unsure how much touring they plan on doing, that they should get a Pinion right away, but for someone who will be using it a lot I do definitely think it's worth the investment, I've found it to be a serious upgrade and I'm very happy with mine.</div>","author":"Tristan Ridley","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_831702","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Tristan Ridley\"> Well, I’m basically trying to move away from cars and driving in general, so an investment like this is worth it to me. \n\nI find way more joy in traveling around by bike, and I’ve honestly gotten sick of driving!\n\nAnd I definitely agree.

Yes they are expensive - no doubt. Yes they would be a headache to deal with if they \"fail\", but that is the case with anything new. The constant added replacement costs for chains, cassette, chain rings, bent derailleur hangers when your chain picks up a stick and wraps around the cassette, and the added thousands of dollars for coin laundry to clean the chain grease off your clothes. To me the \"weight penalty\" is silly - we had Rohloffs on our previous bikes and they were heavier (I think). If you want to save weight leave the folding chair and spare shoes at home or carry less food or lose a few human pounds before you leave. It's not the weight, it's the lack of aerodynamics touring bikes anyway, right? Finally about the whole \"my bikes cheaper than your bike and I have ridden to Mars and back\" thing - sure YOU can ride the cheapest, oldest thing you can find - certainly your call. We spend a medium sized fortune on our bikes, but 1) we tour constantly and want them to be as reliable as humans can make them, simple to pack and put on planes repeatedly, and have exactly the features and characteristics we know from experience matter to us and to the trips we plan to take. 2) Money is a choice across the many things in our lives - we do not own a vacation home, gigantic and useless gas powered vehicle that requires a 7year loan to buy - we live in 700 square feet and live small - you too can find the money for the things you really value - for us that is our touring bikes and gear.

Still looks new. \nPedals smooth. Only real maintenance (besides changing the gearbox oil once a year) is bleeding my hydraulic brakes when needed. \nThree months after I first got it, it even got dragged off the back of a bike shuttle trailer, then took a flying leap at 60mph!\n(I can tell you 100%, it’s a real sick feeling to see something like that happening in real time to your bike as it bounces and bounds down the highway 🫣)\nExcept for it turning my handle bars askew, some scraped off parts of the carbon handle bars, grips, and fork mounted bottle cages, it came through all that solid as a rock. I even sent it back to the builder to make sure the frame wasn’t bent and the gear box was undamaged. It checked out perfect! (whew!)\nI use mine generally for multi-day bikepacking, so don’t really care about speed, just durability. But I’ve gotten rid of all my other bikes and ride this one exclusively whether road, gravel, dirt, or whatever. \nSome of you have mentioned  what about breaking a belt in the field. Well, I just carry an extra belt. It weighs maybe 1oz and easily tucks into my handlebar bag. \nThe builder gave me 4 extra with the original bike build. So that many should last me quite a long time. I did get a stick stuck in the rear belt ring once that made the belt pop off. It was easy peasy to put back on. And no greasy hands!\nOne other thing that really nice about the belt drive is how easy it is to take the rear wheel off if you need to change the tire. \nEverywhere I go, people oooo and ahhhh at my bike.

Previously running top-spec SRAM and Shimano 1x and 2x drivetrains, on carbon frames.\nEarly days in my relationships with internal transmission/belt drive systems ... about two years, around 10,000 km, and more than 100,000 metres of climbing; largely in the backcountry.  29'er hardtail, and 27.5\" fatbike.  My riding tactics have been fundamentally improved by how the entire drivetrain functions and performs!!!\nPros:- no requirement to sequentially shift is a game-changer!  You'll need to figure out what works for your riding styles and conditions.- greatly reduced shifting fatigue on longer routes. I typically have significant hand-strength issues (that impact shifting capabilities) after about 500 km.  This issue is no longer something that I need to plan for.- rock gardens and super-tight lines are no big deal.  If you and your pedals can grind through the feature, the drive train will also.- mud, sand,gravel, even bentonite clays clear quickly and efficiently from the drive train.- no need for regular cleaning or any lubrication of drive lines.- Much lower cost!!!  Again, early days.  Initial indications  (based on a review of 6 years of my derailleur maintenance records, ~ 50,  000 km) is that the Pinion/Gates system has a 5-10% return on capital employed.  If factoring in lifetime titanium vs. recyclable carbon frames this number is likely wildly conservative!\nCons:- high initial cost of a complete system; can be quite daunting, particularly if not considering full-cycle costs.- aluminium sprockets and cogs wear quite quickly (&lt;5,000 km in my experience) which can  also lead to collateral damage to the belt.- there seems to be a lot of inaccurate information on the web about these systems\nThings to monitor closely:- any indications of loosening in the lock-ring attachment between the Pinion transmission and the front sprocket.  I've index marks (red Sharpie) on mine that I visually check prior to riding.- spare belts are light, inexpensive, and easy to change.  Carry one.  I built a special compartment (two layers of VX-21) on the down tube side of a DIY framebag just to store the spare belt.- if riding off trail - grass, pieces of sticks, ice, and other debris tends to accumulate in the Centre-Track of the belt, which over time may stretch the belt.  If riding in any of these conditions I've found it useful to periodically scrape the debris out of the Centre-Track groove.  Perhaps every few hundred kilometres. \nHope you find this perspective informative.\n\nCheers ...</div>","author":"Guy Stuart","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_752355","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Cost, efficiency, weight.
