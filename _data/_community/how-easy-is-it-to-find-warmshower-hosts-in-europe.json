Biking across Spain and France last fall I sent out 44 requests for a place to stay. I got back only 14 responses, most of the responses were that they had either moved or weren’t taking in guests. Those people should make themselves unavailable on the site. My last night in France I was accepted by a family. It was glorious. Now I’m going back and biking with the host who will be my friend forever! That’s what warmshowers should be!</div>","author":"Hall Hitzig","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_107143","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I’ve used it a few times and so far it’s been great! Just make sure to only contact hosts who have been active in the last 2 weeks (ish), (it says on their profile). That way you can avoid having less responses from people who haven’t logged in in ages 🙂</div>","author":"Alex Sidney","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_684158","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">We joined it a couple of months ago for south America. We didn't use it too much but others we met had and did pretty well with responses. We ended up using it a few times to just meet up with local bikers and have made a few fantastic friends from it.

It has grown to be so big that the site needs the small fee to run it properly. It is one of the best parts of bike touring. I encourage everyone to not only pay the fee but to donate more if you can. Many of my best memories of bike tours are the wonderful hosts with whom we have stayed.\nOne tip I give to new users is to send requests to hosts who have a high response rate, which is listed on their profile. And do be sure to read the whole profile. Some of us are on extremely busy routes and get lots of requests, so we may have a hint within the profile for a guest to include in their request in order for us to accept them. Also read the feedback, and be sure to leave one of your own after your stay.</div>","author":"Marti Fine","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_415383","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">There is no fee.
