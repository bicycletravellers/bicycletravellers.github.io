When in doubt I took that other vest, because you never know. I even carried two inner tubes, and one outer tube. \n\nI learned, I am reducing weight whenever I can. If I cannot afford a lightweight version, I think about going completely without. I might replace the outer tube with a sturdy sewing kit. I got lightweight inner tubes.\n\nI am still undecided about both the tarp - I made one which is 2*2 meters, it might be too small - and the sleeping bag. The only way to lose one pound would be to get a down-filled sleeping bag, and I worry about the geese.
