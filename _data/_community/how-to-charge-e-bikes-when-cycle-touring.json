This comes from reasoning that most people travel between 18 and 25 km/h (generally only road racing bikes exceed those speeds, and they ride on roads instead of bike paths anyway). Mofas/snorfietsen are restricted to 25 km/h as well, allowing them to ride on bike paths as well. With those logics in mind, the speed restriction for pedal assisted bikes (not s-pedelecs, not e-bikes) was set to 25 km/h (with tolerance up to 27 km/h).\n\nDe-restriction\nThere are three classes:\n- pedal assisted bikes up to 25 km/h.\n- pedal assisted bikes (so-called s-pedelecs) up to 40 km/h (which then need a license plate, insurance, mandatory helmet, are allowed on streets only, no bike lanes)\n- e bikes that need no assistance, same laws as s-pedelec.\n\nIf you de-restrict a pedelec, it becomes a s-pedelec. As you will have no license plate nor insurance (nor be able to obtain these as the bike is not categorized as such), you will get pulled from traffic (or bike path ulif you're even more stupid), get heavily fined and if you're really running out of luck, the bike will be shredded.\n\nOn an even more extreme note, if you would cause an accident with material damage or bodily harm/death, your normal liability insurance will pay for the damage but will get those costs back from you. And you will know, why you are going to work for. No job, no problem. Someone will be assigned to manage your welfare money, paying all the bills and giving you only a sort of allowance money.\n\nThere is no winning in this situation, which is good.</span></div>","author":"Axel Knobbe","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_465151","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Axel Knobbe\"> You said...\"you\" then allow pedal assisted bikes to go too fast.'... so gain, how does someone 'allow' others to go to fast or more to the point, how do i allow others to go to fast? \nWaffling on about the difference between an ebike and pedal assist has nothing to do with it.

Going down the hill you will not recover all the energy available, probably much less than 50% probably closer to 5-10% at best. My bet is you will still be braking to stop, and the dynamo hubs are not 100% efficient by a long shot. Their output efficiency depends on speed and above a certain speed falls off as they are optimized to create energy at lower speeds. Will the dynamo create energy while going down hill? Yes, but not as much as you would like. Most dynamo hubs create either 3 or 6 volts and about  3 watts to use with lights. ( your ebike uses 100+ watts for a longer period than it takes for you to descend) Most e-bike batteries are 36 volts or higher. So now you must use an upvoltage dc to dc converter which also had inefficiencies. So your plan is to take 3 watts over a short period to offset use of 100 watts over a long period ( a time ratio of climb to descend might be 4:1)  Would it help?  Yes. However without significant input. \n\nFrom a practical stand point you will have to add some circuitry ( how's you electrical design ability?) For very minimal gain. \n\nIf you could design a energy braking system that tapped into what your talking about you could see some efficiency gains ( dynamo hubs are not designed as brakes but for lights) Superpedestrian made a ebike conversion wheel that was designed for just that. Back Pedal their wheel and it went into regenerative braking mode. They saw at most a 10% gain in range ( optimistic claims I'd bet). \nSo I still believe this not fundamentally a good idea or really readily available on the market ( for good reason).\n\nOddly I run a dynamo hub on my ebike.

Of course that is the best time to be riding.</div>","author":"Brian Motter","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_411161","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I‚Äôm on day 4 ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-to-charge-e-bikes-when-cycle-touring/image_1664472981_3022239009.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"David O'Neill","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_804124","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-to-charge-e-bikes-when-cycle-touring/image_1664472981_7826113780.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"David O'Neill","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_965480","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-to-charge-e-bikes-when-cycle-touring/image_1664472981_5829014853.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"David O'Neill","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_856188","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-to-charge-e-bikes-when-cycle-touring/image_1664472981_5827895143.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"David O'Neill","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_197978","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-to-charge-e-bikes-when-cycle-touring/image_1664472981_9039648655.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"David O'Neill","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_872819","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-to-charge-e-bikes-when-cycle-touring/image_1664472981_9191634174.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"David O'Neill","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_131731","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Solar panels, charge controller and inverter or a solar generator</div>","author":"Steven Foley","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_501862","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Long extension cords do it</div>","author":"Lou Roussinos","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_779107","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Lou Roussinos\"> Pantograph, for use with suburban light railways.</span></div>","author":"Jonathan Boucard","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_559681","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Jonathan Boucard\"> indeed</span></div>","author":"Lou Roussinos","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_215936","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">You might tour with an E-Trike where you could mount a solar roof over you &amp; not have to balance the whole thing.
