I have used my Houdini for for trail running and hikes, but not for bicycling. For bicycle touring, I'd recommend a more stormworthy shell. PU-coated (vs. ePTFE laminate) will be the least expensive. Marmot PreCip (lightweight hiking/backpacking/climbing) shell which, at 11 oz., is not as light as a Houdini, but quite stormworthy for its weight, and available for around $75 on sale. Or you could look at bicycle-specific jackets, although I suggest you confirm whether the jacket has ePTFE (e.g., GoreTex) or PU-coating if you want something stormworthy vs. a mere windbreaker. The advantage of a bicycle-specific jacket is that it will likely be cut long in the back to cover your tush better while in riding position.

Have you tried a lightweight ePTFE (e.g., GoreTex) shell with pit zips over a lightweight base layer? I'm a heavy sweater and that combo works for me at 55F or lower -- or 65F if it's very stormy. IME, a heavy rain will penetrate a Houdini within a few minutes, rendering me soaked to the bone. IMV, the choice of shell somewhat depends on the route. If a tour includes high mountain passes, a Houdini would not be stormworthy enough for me.
