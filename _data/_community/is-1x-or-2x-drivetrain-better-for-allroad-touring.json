Anyway, one of the first things I replaced was the 32t chainring with a 36t to make it less spinny on long flats and paved segments.  36t is the absolute largest chainring my frame will allow, which is probably fine as a 1x, since that still allows for great climbing ratios.  But then I consider; if it's fine as a 1x... perhaps it would be even better as a 2x?  I'm thinking 50/34 rings in front, 11-46 11sp in rear.  I don't hate the idea!\n\nIt means a weight penalty for sure, and a financial penalty as well - and it would really lock this bike into being \"the touring bike\".  As a 1x, I can still easily change the wheelset and hit some single track.\n\nI'm pretty equally torn; leave this as a 1x and make do until I get a  proper touring bike next year... or make this a 2x touring bike.  And then purchase a new mountain bike for trails. üòÜ<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_album_attachment\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/is-1x-or-2x-drivetrain-better-for-allroad-touring/image_1655470990_7930697087.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/is-1x-or-2x-drivetrain-better-for-allroad-touring/image_1655470991_9790719613.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/is-1x-or-2x-drivetrain-better-for-allroad-touring/image_1655470991_8555273909.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_459069","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_600924","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">My 2x gets me a much better range of gears, especially on the low end with a 30t front 34t rear.

The single chainring Sutra LTD has 36x11 and a 36x42. The Sutra SE that I purchased has 48x11 to a 26x36 on the granny, understand I like to not spinout when I am going downhill until I am over 40mph. Hell, on my last touring bike I put a 53 big chainring on to replace the 48 it came with, I was a triathlete in my prime at that point, I no longer am. I rode that bike all over the US and Europe, with way more gear than I should have been carrying. I find this suits me best, call me a dinosaur, oh well. I watched my buddy pushing his approx. $10,000 titanium Salsa Fargo with a single chainring, while I rode beside him for a bit hazing, before I finished my trip to the top of the hill. On descents, I also blew right past him. He is a better rider, in better shape and weighs at least 50lbs less than me, before comparing my old Cannondale T2000 to his Fargo. Bottom line, it seems like you are doing hypotheticals, while I am stating what I know works for me, and how it compares to a similar setup a friend spent a whole bunch of money on.

At the top end I spin out at 40kph, which isn't Grand Tour ready, but it's plenty fast enough for touring.\n\nAs you can see, it's not \"range\" that is the issue like everyone claims, it's actually that there are bigger gaps between the gears, which means you have less cadence options.\nThe only time that has ever been an issue for me was when I was riding with a cyclist I met along the way and I couldn't match his speed on certain gradients. When cycling alone or with my partner I've had no problems.\n\nI'd give it a try and see how you like it and consider upgrades/modifications once you've found out if there's something you dont like about it.

My last long, loaded, gravel ride included a 72 mile day with 4200 feet of up (not to mention snow at the top of a pass). 1x drive train. I needed the 36x50 gearing. Have you tried a 17% grade loaded with a 40x42 ratio (original setup)? I don't worry about spinning out downhill or on the flats. It's a marathon, not a sprint. I get used to the cadence issues, just like I switch between 5 keyboards - takes a minute then I don't notice it. Again a non-issue. I don't worry about cross chaining, that's why you get the right chain for the job. They are wear items. \n\nIt all comes down to what fits in your head. Even if I had a 2x I would still want a serious granny gear. On that 17% grade, although short, I nearly burst a lung. The real key for me is that I hit the 17% grade on day 2 of a 3 day ride AFTER the 4200 foot 1st day. I rode another 55 miles on day 3. You have to be able to recover every day.  If you are 20, no problem, push hard. If you are well over 3 times that, pick a setup that allows you to live to fight another day.\n\nOne last thought. I still have all my parts. For the STP supported ride here I will change out my 36 tooth front CR for my 40 and use my other chain. If you have all your parts rig your bike for the ride you are doing. Not hard to do with my 1x setup.</div>","author":"Chuck Perry","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_146046","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I'm a 2 x or 3 x advocate.
