Given 30 days to vacate (it‚Äôs still full-on winter here in Alaska and the rental market is expensive and very tight), I‚Äôve been in a near constant state of panic since March 1, so much so that I also crashed my car. Ahhh. So now I‚Äôm riding my bike to work every day. At 5:15 am I have the city trails to myself and my ride is extremely therapeutic, I have calmed down a lot, and I feel better about life in general. I suppose this couldn‚Äôt have happened to a better person because my big Salsa has massive, studded tires and giant panniers and the bike paths covered in sloping, glaciated ice, running water, and ice chunk-filled potholes are no big deal. I also own a bus, soon to be outfitted with a big bike rack. If I still can‚Äôt find a safe, quiet, affordable place to live soon, I‚Äôll move into the hospital parking lot, quit my job in August, and go on a long bicycle tour instead. Bicycling of any distance or effort is scientifically proven to reduce hypertension and anxiety! (*And please, if you would, don‚Äôt patronize AirB&amp;B.

When going on a cycle trip things inevitably don't go entirely to plan but then some how you manage to cope which increases your belief in your ability to cope. Hence over time the anxiety decreases and enjoyment increases. In addition when things go wrong often others will come to your aid which challenges beliefs about the world being a scary place. Usually the worst that happens is you have to abandon the trip and return home. Then its a learning opportunity. Also when cycling your focus of attention shifts form \"internal\" to \"external\" which reduces any unhelpful internal dialogue.So for Anxiety you need CBT (constant bicycle therapy) Ps my job is a CBT therapist..the other sort.</div>","author":"Angie Dave","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_302766","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Angie Dave\"> I love this, thank you!</span></div>","author":"Ruth Burgess","gender":"FEMALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_685158","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">While ramping up for my cross country tour a couple years ago, I cut back on my Atenolol and Lisinopril while watching my BP.
