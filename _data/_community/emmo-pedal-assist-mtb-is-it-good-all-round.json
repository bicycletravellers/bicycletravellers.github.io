Yamaha and Cannondale have more affordable options than Trek or Specialized.\n\nI don't prescribe to the eBike hate. Most of the haters have never ridden one. Pedal assist eBikes still take effort and still give you good exercise. For the majority of couch to biking folks, an eBike is shown to be better than a standard bike. eBikes will be used more often and longer stretches of time because they don't produce the same type of post exercise pain.\n\nAdditionally some people have health issues where a regular bike would be unrealistic. I myself have both regular and eBike available for this very reason. When I started biking again an eBike made it possible. After about a year of eBiking I was able to get a regular bike as well. Some days though, I'm really really glad I've still got the eBike as an option.\n\nReply with your approximate budget and what distances you plan to ride regularly and I'd be happy to throw out some specific models that might work well.\n\nEdit. Oh and do you prefer flat bars? Or drop bars? Either are definitely good for adventure and bikepacking. Drop bars are the traditional/trendy way to do gravel. Drops give you more options for hand/body position, very helpful on long rides. You also tend to be in a more aerodynamic position with helps anytime you are going over about 15mph. Flat bars are oftentimes seen as simple and more familiar (And oftentimes cheaper).</div>","author":"Christopher Burkhart","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_459811","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Christopher Burkhart\"> this is Exactly was in my mind when I post this message I plan on using it for some real Adventure, maybe 1 to 3 days ride probably 300km or more. Adding more load to the bike will be hard for a regular bike but with a pedal assist might work for those distance! The current bike that I have will be my recreational bike down hill etc. \n\nThe Pedal Assist will be more of a Adventure Longer ride using all kinds of terrain Gravel, Rocky, Muddy etc. I prefer a Flat Bar thats where I am comfortable at.</span></div>","author":"MarkSteve Carreon","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_207393","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"MarkSteve Carreon\"> I'm assuming you'll be stopping overnight at places where you can recharge. Because, unfortunately, 300km wouldn't be achievable in a single charge, even with some of the double battery bikes or bringing a 2nd battery along.\n\nAdditionally, IMHO, you'll need an efficient mid-drive eBike for those distances and terrain.. You'll want to be looking at bikes like a Yamaha Torc or the new Ride1Up Prodigy XC for affordable options in this category. Mid-drive will only give you power as you need it thanks to built-in torque sensors detecting the amount of effort you are putting in... Then allowing the motor to assist with an additional % of power up to your defined limit. Cheaper hub motor setups use cadence sensors... If your legs are spinning, even freely without resistance, it's dumping in the maximum power the current level allows. Giving you the boost and draining power regardless of your need.\n\nCan add a few more options and pros/cons later if needed.</span></div>","author":"Christopher Burkhart","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_567502","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"","author":"Dan O'Brien","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_295071","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Dan O'Brien\"></span></div>","author":"MarkSteve Carreon","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_518097","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I had success with a bafang mid drive conversion for my father, at 74 I can't fault him for wanting a little assistance.
