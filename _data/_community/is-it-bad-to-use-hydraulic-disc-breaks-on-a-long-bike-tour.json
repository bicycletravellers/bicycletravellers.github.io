Too many \"what ifs\" from people who don't do long distance touring but drive cars with hydraulic brakes‚Ä¶ \n\nI'm on tour for 5 continuous years this August. I guess you can say I'm an experienced tourer. I NEVER had a hydraulic brake fail or need repair or maintenance. If one failed, guess what? You have 2. You can go countless miles on 1 brake cos you have NO CHOICE, you will not be riding steep mountains until you fix it, right?\n\nThe only maintenance I do is I replace pads about once a year. I ride in a lot of remote places, high mountains, and steep roads (steepest so far was 29 degrees in Turkey). I've been to countries that are stereotyped to not have parts like Africa, SE Asia, India, S America. Nonsense. Every big city has \"fancy\" bike shops because even people in India for example have the means to buy \"expensive\" bikes to travel the world with‚Ä¶ It's not just Americans or Western Europeans that have \"special\" bikes with hydraulic brakes, large tires, etc. \n\nRegardless, the world is pretty small these days. Anything can be shipped anywhere. Rohloff will ship a replacement hub for free ANYWHERE you are in the world if it fails you. \n\nThe sun will always shine after a storm. That's part of touring. Shit hits the fan. Things get lost, forgotten, stolen, or break. Everything is replaceable or fixable. Even in the most remote places, there will be people to help you. \n\n*If you are going to tour for a few months or longer, learn how to fix every part of your bike and carry the tools and spare parts like pads, chain, lube, etc. Don't fall for the ultra light hype. Tools and parts are essential even if you'll never use them! Even if you'll be riding in your home country. The US is big. It can be many hundreds of miles before there will be a bike shop to save you. \n\nIf a back spoke breaks for example, you'd be happy you carried the cassette remover tools. For long tours (months or years), you will be at 40-60kg (70-130lbs) - bike + gear + food and water. Another 1 kilo/lbs, won't make any difference to your daily average distance.

I'm currently in the mountains in Romania. I never did any maintainance to the hydraulic brakes and I ride with 27.5x2.8 tubless tires. Your statement is outdated a decade or more.\n\nI just changed pads as needed and rotors once because they got bent in shipping (I now take them off the wheels when I fly).  Never had an issue with brake fluid leakage or cable breaking, or brakes failing. \n\nI ride a lot of mountains with steep grades. With 55-60kg (bike + gear + food/water), going down hill up to 79.7kph on paved roads (haven't broke 80 yet), it's nice to be able to drop speed to 20kph in a few short meters before those 180 degree U turns compared to cable breaks. And it takes no effort to use 1 finger on the brake lever. \n\nI also ride with 27.5x2.8 tubeless tires. I carry 1 spare tube in case a tire can't be fixed but the few punctures I had (I ride a lot off road), the sealant fixed it so never used the emergency tube in 5 years of touring but still carry it just in case. Finding tires is easy. Even in Africa or Asia, big cities have good bike shops. Or shipping ahead using www.bikeinn. com is also easy and cheap. The only charged me $20 shipping when I bought new tires to ship to Japan.</span></div>","author":"Adir Sharon","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_482958","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Gerald Raton\"> nope. 5 years of continuous touring around the world current riding through the mountains in Romania.

There are cable discs, cable hydraulic discs and full hydraulic discs. The cable hydraulic discs are easily maintained.

As long as the pads are in good condition, there is no reason not to do a long tour (1000 miles or so ) with them. The pads are very easy to change when they are worn out. Another big advantage is that should you have a mishap and buckle a wheel  you can continue without the brake continually rubbing yhr rim until you can get the wheel trued.\nAs far as I am concerned  the only downside is that the are noisy when yhe discs get wet.
