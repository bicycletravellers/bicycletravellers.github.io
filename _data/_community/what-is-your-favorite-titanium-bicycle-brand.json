My v1 Salsa Cutthroat is equipped with a front suspension, post-mount hydraulic brakes and 1x 12-speed Shimano XT 10-51, good luck building such a rig today. To make matter worse, neither Shimano nor SRAM yet understand the need to have mountain bike range on drop bar mountain bikes, Shimano GRX is still not 12 speed while they have the technology for years and SRAM has yet to come up with a drop bar mountain bike/ gravel group that doesn‚Äôt require batteries.</div>","author":"Guillaume Dougados","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_861539","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Guillaume Dougados\"> I put sram 12 speed on my bearclaw thunderhawk, I put the xx1 10-52 cassette on it with an absolute black oval in front‚Ä¶it‚Äôs been awesome!

SRAM cable-actuated road brifters are compatible with their mountain bike derailleurs. The system allows for example to use Force 1 levers which do have a post-mount hydraulic option, and a GX, X0 or XX 12-speed RD and cassette.</span></div>","author":"Guillaume Dougados","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_636913","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Guillaume Dougados\"> you can put post mount brakes on shimano systems.

There are people that will help you through the process (including me) for a fee or that do it for you and brand it under their name (some named above).  If you end up with a fully custom Ti frame in the $1000 to $2000 range with all the options you ever thoughts about it is usually from one of the few custom Chinese shops which are now quite good.  The only risk is that you fully control the design so if you ask for something stupid, like water bottle bosses under the down tube where the bottle will hit the front wheel, they will build something stupid just as you requested...
