Seems like I asked for more advice than  I give. I have Parkinson's so I have limited mobility and strength in my hands. When it comes to packing a tent, is it okay to stuff it into a pannier or a dry bag without folding and rolling it? That is how I pack my sleeping bag I just stuff it into the bottom of my pannier. I have a 13 l ortlieb dry bag that I could stuff my tent, fly and ground sheet into very easily. My thinking is that when I got home I could always set it up to dry and fold it and Roll It and then store it and it's factory bag with some help from my wife. Any other easy Packing Tips would be appreciated</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_848875","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_322594","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">All good to stuff anything</div>","author":"Roberge Pat","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_965397","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Folding and rolling is actually discouraged as it can cause damage to the area at the fold.
