If it is fully stuffed then you can't and this will shift the weight backwards. If the bag weight is evenly distributed in the bag, then the centre of gravity will possibly be behind the rear axle. This will lighten the front end of the bike which will affect handling. Also if the bag is pushed way back, there is less surface area of whatever the bag is mounted on  to provide support.\n\nWith the bag mounted side to side the weight will be further out to the sides, but the c of g will be further forward. And you will support the bag with the panniers beneath it.\n\nI put my bag side to side, but that is because my bag is both bulky and heavy. This does limit access to the rear panniers, but all my daily use stuff is in the front panniers or the handlebar bag.</div>","author":"Mark Perry","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_519365","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Definitely crossways - You need to bring the Centre of Gravity as far forward as possible to avoid some odd steering issues.
