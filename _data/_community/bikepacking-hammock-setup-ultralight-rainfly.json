Filled my backpack with my camping gear and went. Probably the biggest fail of the gear was my \"rainfly\" (polysil window insulation). \n\nWhat are some suggestions for an ultralight rainfly?\nOne of my thoughts was trying again and maybe getting some shock cord to attach it to either the trees or further up my hammock straps.\n\nHas anyone tried the hummingbird gear hammock straps? Any other UL hammock straps that are worth it?\n\nThanks!<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"post_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/bikepacking-hammock-setup-ultralight-rainfly/image_1657900958_8193445505.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_389867","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_551088","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">The classic hammock/tarp layout, uses a ridge line, you can use para cord, or you do get lighter cord out there such as amsteel.  This can be tied to the trees, or any point along the hammock attachment line to the trees.  The minimum connection point  is about 15 cm on the webbing each end before your hammock connectors.  The tarp then hangs over this ridge line.  The tarp is attache to the ridge-line and tensioned using a running knot such as a prusik loop.  The ridge line takes the weight of the fly, without creating too much tension in it . This will keep the material away from your face, the higher up the connection line you go, the more headroom you have in the hammock.....but the more material you need for the tarp to still keep the hammock sheltered from rain.  A silnylon tarp can be quite cheap, cuban fibre is incredible light.....but very rustley and more expensive.  Woven material is generally stronger than plastic sheeting, and one would generally look to guy the corners out.  Hope that helps, but I am sure seasoned hammockers can give better insight.</div>","author":"Graeme Thomson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_402499","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">So you may have opened a whole can of worms here.  There are a variety of different hanging options for ultralighters.  Whoopie slings, dyneema straps, dyneema ropes, Dutchware products, holy moly it goes on and on.  I just went down this rabbit hole myself over the weekend and I've probably decided on a simple set of plan dyneema straps from Ripstop By The Roll with a universal loop from Jeff Myers.  Light, cheap, but not at simple as my older strap setup.  The 10oz saving will make it worth it, though.\n\nHere's a place to start from:  WARNING, rabbit hole...  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wTe5AZS2Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wTe5AZS2Y</a></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dl4wTe5AZS2Y&amp;h=AT3NxV7qqgO4wOn39U15ny5NETLEZEE78SgGmDobhOnEMr9vCuJN8-RynZiYVn4zswdjhAyt6nbnEWQNggZEO3r_mD35KGQKoZOiAA_jB_WESVjmMKnHIOVU8k_h2-yOWaLg7bhciVGQ6MCt4ALuR3xwfC03zxxJ4CA&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l4wTe5AZS2Y/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">ULTRALIGHT HAMMOCK SUSPENSIONS</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">youtube.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Joshua Ulery","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_693407","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Joshua Ulery\"> looks like the dyneema from rip stop by the roll is no longer available?</span></div>","author":"Kathryn Hoffberg","gender":"FEMALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_586681","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Kathryn Hoffberg\"> maybe this?  <a href=\"https://ripstopbytheroll.com/products/venom-uhmwpe-ultralight-webbing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ripstopbytheroll.com/products/venom-uhmwpe-ultralight-webbing</a></span></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fripstopbytheroll.com%2Fproducts%2Fvenom-uhmwpe-ultralight-webbing&amp;h=AT16Ed5uRXf48VoMgIfVQOfluQoo7dSfyH_-rTTlLxb2bBY-mftIgqNjvXxdV-mSsQNP0xdzYcDnb3p_bVya_bfuBXDSGDd-SzSg4Ea1p9d9O6m47E7MkuKYGwJo-8JMRkrSkCJdcIZ9ntRb9cx3geFLHAqYvvhowTU&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0261/6507/products/Venom_1_inch_1200x1200.jpg?v=1566196005\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Venom™ UHMWPE Ultralight Webbing</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">ripstopbytheroll.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Joshua Ulery","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_331522","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Joshua Ulery\"> oh, looks like they updated it then and the previous version was discontinued</span></div>","author":"Kathryn Hoffberg","gender":"FEMALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_53141","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Almost every town has a pavilion. \n\nYou can also try a one person bivvy.\n\nHammocks are too much of a hassle.</div>","author":"Aaron Lad","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_872924","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Aaron Lad\"> great input.
