I thought I knew what I was doing until I did my first a year ago, getting the weight down wasn't to tricky as I have good hiking kit but getting the bulk down was the biggest challenge. Since then I've done a fair few trips and each time I learn something new. Getting the weight low and in the middle of the bike helps a lot. Quite like the POD kit is cheap, well made and waterproof but a tad heavy. I do a lot of bivvy camping anyway so use to using tarps, it's a good option a 3.0 X 2.9  DD Superlight is under 500 grams and very compact but cost around 70 quid then you will need a pole unless you can use a tree. Then you need a ground sheet and bivvy so this soon makes it the same weight as the soloist if not more but loads of room.

Tents are better for base camping, where you are basing your self in one place and cycling out each day. Tents are also better protection from biting insects.....bivi's can give protection if you are reading or sleeping.....but it is less easy, doable just less easy, to eat in a bivi.  I once spent an evening running around my bivi bag trying to avoid the insects whilst I had my dinner....that I had to cook in the open surrounded by the varmits.</div>","author":"Graeme Thomson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
