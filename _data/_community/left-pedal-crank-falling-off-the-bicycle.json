First time I was in shock as I have never had a bike with such system and I never expected a failure of this kind. First time was on a pretty much new bike after 300km. I then took the bike to my LBS for fixing thinking it might just have been not fitted properly to start with and after another 300 km I had it happen again. This being a bike I plan to use for long term touring in the future I feel a bit concerned about the issue. Not something I would enjoy happening if touring in a remote part of the world! The crankset both times fell completely off and besides being dangerous if it happens in traffic I suppose the crankset could get lost or damaged and you are in for a very long walk... Has anybody similar issues? Is it advisable to replace this system for something more old fashioned, reliable and sturdy???

You really shouldn't be getting enough leverage to pull the crank off twice in so little mileage.

Had lots of other different issues though!!!\n\n- What model year is your Sutra?\n- Do you know the exact spec of the bottom bracket installed?\n- Can you send back photo from the underside of your you bike with a caliper or ruler measuring the shell width?\n\nAlternatively, take the cranks out and see how the left crank fits off the bike vs on. I think the crank arm is either not going fully onto the crank axle or there is too much space for your pedal arm.\n\nIf too much or too little width across the crank axle, start with the bottom bracket and spacer configuration. The arm coming off may be the symptom, not the cause. Too much space will give it leverage to work it's way off.

Use a torque wrench to check that the final tightening torques are within the range of 12 - 14 N¬∑m.\nFurthermore, after riding approximately 100 km (60 miles), use a torque wrench to \nre-check the tightening torques.\nIt is also important to periodically check the tightening torques.\nIf the tightening torques are too low or if the mounting bolts are not tightened \nalternately in stages, the left crank arm may come off during the ride causing the \nrider to lose control and fall.\n* Service Instructions in further languages are available at:\n<a href=\"http://si.shimano.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://si.shimano.com</a>\nPlease note: specifications are subject to change for improvement without notice. \n¬© Jan. 2016 by Shimano Inc.
