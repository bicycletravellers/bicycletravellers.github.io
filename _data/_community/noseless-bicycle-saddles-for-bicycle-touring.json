Find a bike shop that offers this service for many years and also have a look for some high quality padded underwear. Like from Assos - the pad has not to be thick but suitable for sensitive skin and should have left tons of damping ability after many miles. In thick soft pads you sink down through and will sit again on the saddle after a couple of miles. And than you will have the same problems again. The Charge Laddle helped many femals to sit longer on their bikes. Also Terry builds some fine saddles for the female ergonomics and some are happy with SQLab or Ergon.
