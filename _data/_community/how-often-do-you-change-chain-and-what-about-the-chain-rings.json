I figure out where the last good touring bike shop will be along my route and make sure things are OK with the bike before I head off into more remote places ie Istanbul before heading east to the Pamier Mountains (Tajikistan).  You can always take links out of your chain if you really get into trouble, done that a few times. The spares I really take are fixing kits for my cooker, tent pole shim, extra hooks for my ortlieb panniers (suprising how many times tou break these). Bike stuff you can usually find along the way or at least a roadside bike shop that will find some fantastic way to fix your bike that you never even thought of.</span></div>","author":"Barry Warner","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_650415","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Giulia Juhé\"> KMC 10 000+</span></div>","author":"Uknowho Ornot","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_822651","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Oh ok. It is not that if you use the chain till \"end of life\" as per the wear indicator, something comes to a standstill. No. It means, if you continue to use a written out chain, other parts wear out faster. That typically means the cassette and chain wheel. \n\nA very well cared for cycle and a lucky rider can expect that a cassette needs replacement at end of the 3rd chains life. And a chain wheel when the 3rd cassette comes to its end of life. Real life expectancy can vary. And this, if the chain is cleaned and lubed every 300 km or so. That would be 2 days if you are on tour. \n\nWhat I see is, people simply continue riding on and either do maintenance at goods shops, or replace the drivetrain or the whole cycle at end of a journey. At least, this is what I have seen in cases where i have closely followed a traveller. \n\nI guess such things loose importance while on the road that people rarely post about maintenance in SM / FB. \n\nBut yes, if like to hear first hand.</div>","author":"Mahesh T Pai","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_164808","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Ride belt drive belt about every 30.000k rear cog i swap about every 15.000 front too and i sent the worn ones home for complete wear down around home town etc</div>","author":"Menno Pieters","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_857489","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Ideally I like to start with new cadette and chain, should last for 4 to 6 months.
