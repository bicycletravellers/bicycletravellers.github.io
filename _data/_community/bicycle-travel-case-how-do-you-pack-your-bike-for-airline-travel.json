I fill my 2 top tube bags with tools. With the weight of the box, tape, and padding, you will be close to 23kg. Tent poles and sleep pads might fit in and tools could go in your panniers if you're overweight. The panniers can be filled, wrapped in plastic and taped together. If you have more stuff, you can fill a cheap plastic-type zippered bag with all your gear and tape it so it looks tidy. If you plan to unpack at the airport, then having the panniers already packed is the easiest way. Airlines will accept anything that looks solid and well-packed. I have made boxes, used tarps, motorcycle covers, heavy clear plastic and even legitimate bike bags. I have a very light day pack for carry-on which is also my grocery bag. Good luck.</div>",
