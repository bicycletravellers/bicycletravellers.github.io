Instead of camping on the side of road, go into the trees and bushes a tiny bit further, that way it's less likely anyone will know your there. I choose roadside spots that look overgrown and non visible. I also think of wind shelter and sometimes trees to hammock. I suggest being stealthy and ninja skills to not be seen. It's easy as when you think it through...  It's our world, not the government or council. we as human beings have a right to quietly camp without bothering anyone. If you ever do get a fine, pay it and hide better next time. I'd be very angry with the way our modern world works if a traveler can't go to sleep peacefully without being rudely interrupted by police officer who then goes on to fine you of your precious money, wrongly thinking he or she is helping the community by moving you off. If your discreet youl be okay in some bushes and trees, just check how visible you are.</div>","author":"William Sloth","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_514291","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"William Sloth\"> I think it would be safer also to be hidden from people that might try to mug you .</span></div>","author":"Gary Carlsten","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_858914","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Gary Carlsten\"> yeah. In a way, if your always paranoid and worrying about your expensive bike and gear and wallet and passport...  I put bike in tent with all belongings..  I have small fishing bells built to alert when you catch a fish, they work well to clip onto your inner tent at the zips and opening flap.. Then, when ya hear the bells going off just grab your blade or pepper spray. I personally have little to no income so a 6000 dollar bike is to me like a car is to a businessman, an investment and a major part of daily life so it's understandable that I trust no one. I don't leave it out front of shops, I put inside there door. I don't even trust the shop owner...   I smoked weed in my teenage years and found my drug paranoia about my wallet and mobile theft was a tool to use for theft prevention..
