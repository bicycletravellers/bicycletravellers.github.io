This is not something that rarely gets thrashed out here enough so let's do it. \n\nWhen i travel, (for between 2 and six months) in a foreign country, i really like to learn about the culture and as i'm an arty farty type, i love to visit museums and the important cultural buildings. Honestly, i'm not good at reading history but can occasionally be lured into it. There's a lot of museums i dont visit and i wish i could afford to partake (hate that word) of more cultural activities when i am in a country. \n\nFood is another big cultural experience i wish i could do more of when in some place. But the limitations on my activities are mainly due to budget constraints. \n\nIt is just not enough to ride through a country and see the landscape and meet the locals. I need more than that, even though some countries, india for instance is extremely rich in the quotidian culture front. \n\nSo engage with this topic any way you like but please list the things that are important to you on a bike tour - like is it just finding the best natural landscapes and features or which cultural activities turn you one? \n\nWhat's your philosophy when it comes to these things and balancing them out. \n\nComments of more than one sentence earn one gold star for effort! :-)</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_237094","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_663913","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Eat.

Learning about the landscape, the history and events that shaped the areas I ride is also very enjoyable it adds an extra element to the planning and enriches the ride. It‚Äôs not always about museums but more understanding why things are the way they are and appreciating the stories that lie beneath our wheels. I really like visiting cafes, pubs etc and just meeting interesting people and seeing that whilst we all have different perspectives we all have much more common ground than differences.

Also long walks through cities. Going to local events and eating and drinking a lot of food (though that is less a priority after I became plant-based üòê)\n\nWhen I plan my trips and pick out my route my secondary plan is \"what is there to do or see in each city/town or along way?\"\nI make a \"have to see/do and would be nice to see/do\".\n\nI usually try to ride 3 days on and one day off. And allow myself time for things I never planned. I used to be an archaeologist so that sometimes influences my stops but I like to see the weird and wonderful so Atlas Obscura research is done.\n\nHowever my last cycle tour in Fall of 2019 really hit my core. I did these tours as an adventure to accomplish, to grow and learn about the world and to help mental health.\n\nWhile all these are good character building they are individual-based (lack of better word selfish). My goals are to make a positive impact out side my own circles. So on that last tour seeing how many stray dogs there were I ended up focusing a lot on helping as many as I could.\n\nAs I started planning my next tour I switched my initial route and now have a plan to tour India to go to 68 cities to meet and volunteer at a variety of stray animal shelters and places helping dogs. I will donate my time and money and hopefully raise funds to give them along the way through creating exposure.\n\nI was to go this year but diverted my attention to the animals affected in Ukraine. Though not by bike I bought a can in Romania and started driving supplies into Ukraine to help animals. Even though I had to come back to Canada and cannot return at moment I am still hiring driver to continue the work.\n\nIn meantime I am planning and researching more and more into India trip. \n\nAll my subsequent trips will be focused on helping stray animals and working with local groups already doing the work.</div>","author":"Duane Taylor","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_549690","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Duane Taylor\"> In case you haven't been to india before some comments about the dog situation in india: There are a lot of stray dogs and you will notice that most of those you see are healthy. People do feed them. However in some places you come across dogs who have been very badly injured but who have \"recovered\" and just kept on going. It is a terrible thing to so those animals but you also humans in similar condition in some places. They are usually beggers. There are lots of animals shelters and there are some really good animal welfare organisations but i never stumbled upon any by chance. I guess you'd have to research them before you go. Or local people might tell you about them if you ask the right people. It can be sad to find frightened little puppies. \n\nSometimes you do find animals who need urgent medical attention and it can be quite difficult to know what the right thing to do it. Usually the locals already know about them and are either not doing anything , don't know what to do or are helping in some limited way. It depends on the situation. In kerala once i came across a dog who had been recently hit by a vehicle and it looked like it might be paralysed. The locals did nothing. On sunday morning they all filed past on the other side of the road on their way to church! What would you do in this situation? \n\nAnother situation I encountered was a female dog with a prolapsed uterus presumably after giving birth but i dont reallyknow. It was a small place with no vet. What would you do in this situation? \n\nAnother situation was in a big city in Rajasthan where i saw a cow with a prolapsed uterus. What would you do in that situation?\n\nI have admit that before i went to india and or came upon these situations, i did not give any thought to what i would do if came face to face with an awful situation such as those above. But each time i did try to do something and I think in only one situation did i get it really right. \n\nThere were situations where i came across people who needed help. I did help but not as well as i wish i had done. So i would mention this in case you need this info. And i know this will probably seem obvious but when you are india, and in the moment, it will not be as obvious as you think. \n\nWith injured animals, if you can find a Jain they will help the animal and know what to do because the Jains are very animal centred in their spirituality. \nIn india most vets work with farm animals and they are not really set up to take care of pets and individuals but they will probably help if you approach them. They can be hard to find. \n\nWhen it comes to people, remember there is always Mother Theresa's for those who are really really sick and near death's door, and taking a person to hospital in a rickhsaw is not a bad idea even when there are hundreds of people mulling around doing nothing because the person is normally a begger and lives on the streets. A lot of poor people or crippled people get their food from restaurants and basically set up home outside their door so that the patrons can give them their leftovers on the way out. You dont really see this a lot but i was with friends in mumbai and they always had food to give to the poor people when leaving a restaurant. \n\nI never saw a lot of incidents with people who really needed my help beyond the usual beggers but those few occasions when i did have those encounters it pays to know what to do. \n\nIf you are going to be mingling with dogs a lot, i would get rabies vaccinations in advance because if a dog bites you, you will basically have to abandon your trip and go either back to delhi or home to get the urgent immunoglobulin shot. Maybe you already know all this.</span></div>","author":"Andrea Collisson","gender":"FEMALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_291954","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Andrea Collisson\"> I have already done a lot of research on stray dogs and the organizations that help them.\n\nI have been in contact with dozens of them and learned a lot. I also support many of them financially. As I also do in Ukraine, Moldova and other places.\n\nAs far as what to do when I come across animals. I have learned a lot about that after being through so many countries and dealing with this. I also will be getting all vaccines needed at the appropriate time before actually going. I expect I will get bitten a few times given how much pain some of these animals will love in and their innate distrust of humans (especially men). Although I have no been bitten yet in my efforts I have come close. I am trying to arrange quitting my job and making this my full time raison d'√™tre. I already set up a project called IMPACT Express (the first iteration was ongoing efforts in Ukraine).\n\nI am currently enrolled in a vet technician course so I am better prepared to do an assement and if I can possibly help. Or if I need to bring them to closest vet and cover the cost. I will be carrying some food but also different types of standard medicines that could be used.\n\nBut mainly my efforts will be to assist those that are already doing this work. I know I can never fully prepare myself for what things are like in person but I am fully prepared for how hard it will be emotionally.

Being alone in nature, the freedom of it all.  But after I had been on the road a few months, maybe as I was coming up to the end of my first year, I realised it had changed.  After a while landscapes get a bit familiar.  There are only so many types of woodland, moorland, beaches, deserts.  Although, I really like countries with different styles of old architecture, like in Romania with their old hilltop citadels.  However, now the main draw for me is the people, because through them and their personal interests I see lots of different sides of their country and culture.  If I stay with someone who is into politics, I learn about the politics of their country, the same goes for history, local wildlife, food and drink, everything üòÖ.  At the moment I'm in Chile and I have learned about their local food, their complicated politics at the moment, their history with the dictatorship, history of how Bolivia lost access to the sea.  I feel that if I meet enough people and talk with them, I learn so much.
