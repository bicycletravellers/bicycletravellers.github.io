I'd used the same packaging before with EasyJet  without  a problem. \"It'll  get damaged \"  she said. So beware  of Ryanair. It might be a policy  to discourage  cyclists. I might just have got the wrong  person on checkin. Ryanair  need to state exactly  what they  mean by \"protective bag\". I've  attempted  to  discuss  it with them. They promised a reply but I'm  still  waiting  2 months  later. It's  their way of dealing  with  things, I think. I had to fly next day with  Jet2.
