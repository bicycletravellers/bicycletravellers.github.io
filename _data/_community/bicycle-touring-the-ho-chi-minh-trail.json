I went from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh. Get visa - took longer for me than they said; ended up having to pay someone online while in airport in HK to do a special quick visa (which means an immigration officer has a side hussle but it work though it costs quite a bit). Buy flight. Get hotel for first night to put bike together unless you have time to do it at airport though I wouldn't recommend that if you aren't a global continuous rider with experience at winging it. Head out. Get a side mirror. Rules of the road in Vietnam: priority goes to the bigger the vehicle - even if it means they are driving on your side of the road to avoid pot holes. Red lights are for decoration. Once you are moving, don't stop or your mess up the organized chaos which could lead to an accident. They are good at avoiding each other while driving in all directions (specially in the bigger cities), especially the scooters. \n\nWild camping is hard to find. With all the rain, humidity, and bugs, and cheap accommodations everywhere, even in small villages, it's the best/easiest option after cycling for the day.\n\nAs far as route: ask locals.. avoid the main highways unless there's no option. Don't ride at night too much because that's when the drunks come out. Your back lights could make them wonder what it is and accidentally, drunkenly, swerve into you.</div>","author":"Adir Sharon","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_403583","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Adir Sharon\"> thanks, I live in Thailand and have been to Vietnam once before, I know about the road tax it seems to be common in South east Asia thanks for your advice . \nHow was the route?

Because it's not the same thing. The Ho Chi Minh trail is not an official trail, but a network of unmarked jungle trails that was used for guerilla warfare against the US and south Vietnamese army in the 1960's and 70's. Cycling between Hanoi and Saigon is perfectly doable. Have done it twice myself.

Right now you'll need to do a visa run after 30 days.  Check out the Vietnam Coracle, though this is more a motorbike website. I would start in Mai Chau and follow the Ho Chi Minh Road down through Pu Luong and through to Phong Nha or right through to Da Nang and then hit the coast for the south central regions. There are some amazing quiet coastal roads and personally I would think this probably a better experience than the ho chi Minh Road all the way through.  Phu Yen province is wonderful. \n\n It's not that hard to stay off highway one and on the back roads.</div>","author":"Sonia Maclean","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
