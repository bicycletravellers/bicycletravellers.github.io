There are plenty of older ones, often sold for very little because they don't meet current trends in MTB design.They are without suspension, with cantilever or other good rim breaks and some made from high end tubing like Reynolds,Tange or Columbus. Some even have braised on rack luggs as they were more conceived of as trail bikes than real rough off road rock hoppers, (although 'Rock hopper' made some like this!)  Being able to fit a rack to braised on mounts is  handy if you want to carry  much gear and any  frame fitted with them should have a touring frameset which if butted  will have thicker walls in the seat tube and other places, although MTB frametube sets are similarly robust. On a road racing frame, due to thinner tube walls in certain vital places,with laden panniers, things can get a bit hairy on downhills with frame  judder, which can affect steering. So,many older non suspension MTBs, if  made from descent tubing make very robust tourers,fitted with  appropriate tyres and they can be bought for next to nothing if you're  lucky. I have one made from Reynolds 531, probably from the early 1990s.</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_420539","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_638878","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Using my old Trek 4300 Disc as mtb, commuter, touring, fishingtrips, shoppings.
