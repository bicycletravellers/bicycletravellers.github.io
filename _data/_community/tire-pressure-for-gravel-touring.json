Went to my LBS and he did not have the tires I was looking for and suggested MountainKings. They had so much more grip than the Assegai's that I had been running, so I started doing some research and realized that almost all the top teams and riders run Continental, from Atherton and Pivot Factory Racing to Brendon Fairclough, Matt Jones and Sam Pilgrim, and I can see why. The tires are made with a slightly smaller ID, making it a little harder to get on the rim but nearly impossible to burp. The Black Chili compound is like gluing yourself to the trail. My daughter and I just ran an enduro up a the top of the UP in Michigan, and it was a rainy weekend. All the riders were complaining about how slippery it was, but we did not slip once, no matter how wet the roots or rocks were. Add in the fact that it was her first time ever going down a mountain, the tires made a huge difference.</span></div>","author":"T.j.
