As a mountain bike rider have played with stem/handlebar lengths. Some stems were too short and never got over the too fast steering.  So I believe there is such a thing as too short.  Maybe fully loaded will dampen the steering, that makes sense.  As to professional fit, I am not sold.  Told him my goals and he just assumed a more upright position would be more comfortable.  I had rode thousands kms, including a 70 day tour....0 pain, stiffness, etc.  No change in pedal height. We did dial in saddle, but I did that. Just easier with help and a stand.  Got same results solo, just takes a lot longer.  As to flat bars....not enough hand position.  I ride mountain bike more often than touring/gravel bike.  I am intrigued by butterfly bars though.</div>","author":"Tom Watson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_683550","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">'Twitchy' is all you.  Sounds like you were accustomed to an odd fit where you had to over-compensate for a poor posture, &amp; fixing the posture gave you a sudden over-abundance of strength where you could relax a bit.  Just continue to settle into it.  I always want to avoid over-loading the inertia in the steering rotation so I can react easily.  \n\nKeep aware of the fact that on a diamond frame a lot of balance is in micro-cantilever rotations from your feet that you normally don't think about - what I had to re-learn when I switched to a high-racer recumbent where I had to make those same micro-cantilever rotations from my hips instead of my feet.</div>","author":"Mike Dannheim","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_667405","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Twitchiness will most likely be caused by not enough weight on the front wheel.

Was very suspicious at first because now I'm no longer Tadej Pogacar in the Tour de France, just a regular (cyclo-cross-ish) dude on a bike.  I find it \"extremely\" comfortable. I can go longer distances because of it, but it's probably slightly tougher against the wind, unless you get down on the drops.  Still, 120 km feels like a breeze now.  Just a wonderful ride, without having to stoop down all the time.\n\nBut, I think one has to back up every so often and ask oneself: What am I doing on this bike? before even getting to the bikefit.  So, I try to list the reasons:\n\n1. Health, happiness, well-being.\n2. Pandemic-era transportation and distancing while travelling.\n3. Loneliness: you want to see people, somehow, some way.\n4. Exploration, navigation, mapping, discovery.\n5. Racing?\n\nFor others, they may have different reasons:\n\n1. To deliver groceries.\n2. To walk my niece to school 9 km away.\n3. Travelling about visiting friends.\n4. Going fishing, and back again.\n5. Just for fun, to get out a bit.\n6.  \"Because I have nuthin better to do.\"\n7. To help me think.\n8. To get away from my wife/husband/girlfriend/boyfriend.\n\nSo, whether it's an escape vehicle, or for delivering eggs, or for exercise, or for winning the Tour de France, the bike has to be fashioned into some kind of specialized instrument to achieve that purpose.\n\nIf I'm training for the Tour de France, I'd go for a long stem. All other situations I'd look at shortening the stem, because doing so changes your entire body position and the way the muscles work, to make it easier (in my opinion).  The alleged loss of aero also comes with a gain in comfort.  The gain in comfort alone should provide more speed, even if you lose some from the loss of aero.</div>","author":"Bruce Conway","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_615006","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Over the years of working in bike shops I have encountered many different systems that purport to provide people with optimal fit on their bike.

There's a sweet spot for being comfortable after that you are losing so much wattage because of drag due to body position. Biggest gains on the bike are aero gains regardless you are going slow or fast. That's why a lot of tourers are getting rid of side bags and using more and more saddle and frame packs.
