The Moots are expensive, but both have 2 wheelsets for good road and gravel performance and get ridden a lot.  Over the long haul will be reasonable cost per mile.  One of the Moots is mine, a Routt 45.  Its geometry is very well judged, construction is meticulous, and ride is exceptionally solid and confidence inspiring.
