Saves a lot of faff. I spent the last year touring with a few variations of a frame bag type set up. I found packing the seat bag (in my case 16.5L Ortlieb) to be a hassle overall. To pack it well I usually had to remove it from the bike to squeeze my sleeping quilt and mat back in properly. You can't over-pack these seat packs either, otherwise they will sag/wiggle behind. I missed the simplicity of a few small panniers to easily remove/reattach and store food in without thinking so much about how and whether it will fit. From a weight perspective the ortlieb seat pack (empty) weighed about 800g. The tourtec rack I put on recently weighs 450g and the two Ortlieb panniers about 450g each. That minimal weight increase isn't worth considering and it won't change the way I ride and where I ride. While I can see a streamlined bikepacking rig may work for someone on a short tour of a few days or a race where little food is being carried, it's otherwise far simpler and more sensible/practical to use a few panniers. Don't get caught out by the marketing and social media hype showing all the new bike-packing bags.
