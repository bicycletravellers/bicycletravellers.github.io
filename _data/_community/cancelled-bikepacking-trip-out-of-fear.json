Long winded background, I apologize.\n\nI tried bikepacking for the first time (solo), loaded up, weather looked great spirits were high, and I was about 15 miles from my campsite when suddenly the weather took a turn for the worse. It was pouring rain, whipping wind, with a bad thunderstorm directly overhead. A couple trees came down across the trail I was on, at times gusts almost knocked me over, and despite all my rain gear my shoes and socks became a puddle. I took shelter under a bridge, where the thunderstorm got much worse (I‚Äôm terrified of lightning). My electronics bag also soaked through, because it was out of my dry bag when the downpour started.\n\nBetween the wet shoes, the wet electronics, the anxiety from the thunder, and a closure of part of the trail due to downed trees, when I got a gap in the weather I ended up bailing and going home by train. Now that I‚Äôm home, I kind of regret that decision. The weather eventually passed, and all the problems that I had could have been easily overcome. But in the moment I was overwhelmed and didn‚Äôt have the resolve to push though. \n\nSo my question is this: for those who have struggled with this or something similar in the past, how do you get over it? Any advice to follow through and actually finish trips? I know there‚Äôs nothing wrong with bailing, and it should always be considered when safety is an issue, but what about when discomfort is the biggest risk?\n\nThanks in advance.</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_737279","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_28118","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Maybe you should road bike....</div>","author":"Evan Johnson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_510880","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Evan Johnson\"> not the answer I was looking for.

I understand your concerns. I have two little mantras that I use to push me through:\n\nIf afraid to go, go anyway. Go with fear.\nIf one person can do it, so can another.\n\nThe second one informs the first. I am astounded everyday when I read what others have done bike packing. Sub-zero weather, bears, war zones... I am pretty sure that most had some anxiety around the first step of that journey. They started anyway. Look at all that bike packers (and humanity) have accomplished. It is highly probable that you will survive your adventure. If not, you will go down in legend. \n\nPrepare the best you can.

Experience is a better teacher than any advice someone can tell you offhand. Having said that, I've made sure every one of my bikepacking bags are waterproof, and I pack them so worst-case scenarios can be dealt with quickly. Raincoat and first aid is at the top of any bag they live in. Electronics can be convenient to get but protected from water when not in use.

Just have your belonging in the right bags, what can get wet doesn't matter, but electronics, wallet, cellphone,etc alway in plastic or drybags. Try to get cover when you see is getting bad, don't wait till is a nightmare. I talk to myself like:If you quit now, for sure in 3 hours is the sun out or tomorrow will be better. Find refuge where you can let it pass, don't take important decisions in stress, sleep it over, if you have to get a hotel...do it, the next day you will feel better and if not...then get the hell out, I always hear to my inside voice and til now never regret it, better sad and safe than sorry!
