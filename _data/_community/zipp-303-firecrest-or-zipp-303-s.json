My hopes are the graphic will bring more attention to my first world problem.  Please read entire post before responding.  The ‚ùì is would you spend the extra $600 and get the 303 Firecrest over the 303 S?  Bare in mind that I have a philosophy about purchases like this.  And not settling, and then later regretting not spending the extra $.  A conundrum as I feel stuck in this decision.  Flipping a ü™ô perhaps may be easier.\n\nCurrent wheelset on my Bearclaw Thunderhawk is nearing it's end just a bit earlier than I was ready for.  I don't have a lot of time to build something up and try to even build a custom wheelset.  So with that in mind I had looked over Hunt as well as many others.  In the end, the availability and the warranty has me as Zipp.\n\nWithout getting into every single piece of gear on the rig, I'll just say that overall I try not to carry the kitchen sink.  And much of the bikepacking I do is here in the desert southwest.  Where one moment I could be on gravel stretches for countless miles, and then asphalt intermittently connecting.  So...either wheel works.  \n\nNot looking for advice on other wheelsets as I'd prefer to stay on topic of these two wheelsets.  But I also think it would be ridiculous not to hear those as well.  But preference is to decide on these two wheelsets.\n\nAs I sit here, I feel slightly rushed as I don't know honestly how much more life my current wheelset has left.  Ordering on Friday, so I have a few more days.\n\nThanks in advance for taking the time to respond.<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"post_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/zipp-303-firecrest-or-zipp-303-s/image_1655827286_8376027610.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_318450","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_23544","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">303s great value.
