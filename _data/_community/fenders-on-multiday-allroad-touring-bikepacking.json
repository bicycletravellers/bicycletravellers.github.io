Ive gotta say... just riding around town, I don't love fenders on this bike.  I don't like the esthetic, how they collect debris on muddy backroads, or how gravel gets kicked up and rattles about in them (and yes, I realize that last one means they're doing their job and saving my frame from chips and scratches).  But of course, I understand they'd make a wet ride less unpleasant.
