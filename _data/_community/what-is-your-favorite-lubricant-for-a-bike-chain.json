Up in Tahoe when the dirt gets dry we have ‚Äúmoon dust‚Äù and around the 50km mark chains start to make noise with the dust collecting on the chain so I carry a little 10ml bottle of lube to reapply mid ride when necessary. With the hot melt wax I can typically go twice the distance without and noise. When I wash the bike I use a scrub brush and soapy water and it cleans the dust off and it‚Äôs good to go again.
