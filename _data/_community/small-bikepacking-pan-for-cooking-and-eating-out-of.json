Coated pans are also looked upon with disfavour. If you were using these over long periods you might take more notice of this. Stainless is heavy, food doesn't burn so easily. Titanium is light but expensive. The issue some have is that food burns a little easier. Jetboil are really fast at boiling water. They really are best for doing just that, so best used with dehydrated foods you just add water to. Their design, pot mounted on top of canister, can be a little unstable. Some people use gas stoves with short flexible hoses so the pans are more stable. The OEX vulcan is good for this at the cheap end of the market. Piezo works, but always carry a second ignition source because piezo doesn't always work. Cutlery? A long-handled spork. The thing is....\nare you actually going to cook? Some long term walkers and cyclists only make coffee in the morning and a drink at night. They pick up food on the way, they eat fruit and bread with spread combinations. In other words, think about needs first, then buy, practice on short trips and be prepared to change the whole lot.</div>","author":"Peter Jeynes","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_284415","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Most things can be cooked in a 750 pot/cup however, if you want something a bit larger then look at the Alpkit Alipot set.
