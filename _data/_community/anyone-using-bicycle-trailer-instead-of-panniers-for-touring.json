This can become very difficult to maneuver when riding downhill at high speeds. As it does not have a brake of its own, trying to brake with the bike can and will be a struggle if speed is not maintained. The trailer will continue to move forward with weight and it will almost try to overpass if speed is not contained. This is one experience no one thinks of unless they under go such extremes. Very frightenting for none experienced and very well serves to watch speed with trailers on downhill runs.
