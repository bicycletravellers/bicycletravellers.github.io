Do you rest on your hands more? With MTB and gravel, which tend to be more active, you might be pushing harder on the pedals and lessening strain on the rest, while with the tourer, you might be sitting more .....  Fitting a touring bike is no different than fitting any other bike.  The mechanics and proportions of the body don't change ....  Your pedal/BB/seat relationship should always be about the same, maybe very marginally altered because your weight distribution is a little different while more upright, but not a lot ,,,  from there your arms fall naturally to certain places, which is where the bars should go.  Anyone who does bike fittings should be able to fit you to any bike, ridden in any posture. You can also do a lot on your own. I generally lean my bike against the washer/drier on one side, sit in the saddle, and have my foot on a milk crate or tool box on the other side, then lean forward the amount which seems comfortable, and see where my hands fall, and then adjust to put my contact points there. It has worked for me for years. of course, I am probably wasting a few watts of power for not being laser-edge optimized ....  but I am also also 70 pounds overweight, so \"optimized\" is more of a comical idea than a goal.</div>","author":"Chris Jasurek","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_179641","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Chris Jasurek\"> I’ll look at it again.
