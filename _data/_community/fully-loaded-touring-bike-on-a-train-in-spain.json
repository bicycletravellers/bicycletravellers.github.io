In order to reserve I had to go to the train station in Valencia. I managed to get to my destination. But on the way back there were no more spots available. I had to call in order to make a reservation but it‚Äôs in Spanish. Not easy. Ok MD spots were full, but I was sure I could still take the local train (vicinity Valencia) in order to be back in time to take the plane home. Because I didn‚Äôt trust it I asked the tourist office to call to reassure me. But big problem I couldn‚Äôt take the local train with the bike because it‚Äôs a special festivity time (which was changed because of covid) and trains don‚Äôt take bikes during these days. Fortunately I could take a bus with my bike in the bag storage without hassle. I could have ridden the 70km in one day but the weather became torrential. So as long as it works it‚Äôs ok but don‚Äôt expect the same bike service as in Netherlands.
