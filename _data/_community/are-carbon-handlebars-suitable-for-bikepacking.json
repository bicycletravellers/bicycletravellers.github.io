I‚Äôm currently running Race Face turbine alloy bars on the bike.  \nI have a pair of race face carbon bars on my full-suspension bike and do notice a difference in hand fatigue on long rides with the alloy bars on the SS bike. \nObviously, it‚Äôs a bit different riding style on the SS to the FS bike(more standing, torquing, etc on the SS), so I‚Äôm sure that contributes to the fatigue, but I‚Äôm just curious/concerned about the strength/capabilities of carbon bars loaded up with a handle bar bag over the long haul. \n\nAppreciate thoughts.<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"post_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/are-carbon-handlebars-suitable-for-bikepacking/image_1655541848_1708608013.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_869364","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_207306","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Trying to save 3 oz?
