The files suck. I feel like I have some experience. I've been a photographer for ~30 years. Shot AHL hockey and minor league baseball all-star games. Cyclecross and MTB, Div 1 collegiate athletics including soccer, tennis, track, among other sports over the years. I'm not trying to big time you, I'm just pointing out I have some clue as to image quality. But phone files just plain suck and gopro stills aren't much better. I always shoot raw (DNG) +DRO (jpeg) on my phone to get the best files for both immediate Instagram use and archival/edit use. But if you plan to do anything besides low res web work, you are going to struggle with a phone. For me the minimum is a decent digital compact in RAW. Besides that phones are just awkward to work with when a camera has physical dials and menus that make sense. OpenCamera is the best cellphone camera I've used.</span></div>","author":"Justin Serpico","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_445756","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Justin\">, I'm a pro photographer and a camera is just a tool.

Having all your eggs in one basket seems like a bad idea. Photos, nav, communications hinging on one single non removable memory card (in most phones now) and no interchangeable battery, which means, a single USB (or whatever Apple uses these days) port to keep your photos, nav and coms running. Worse, often sat comm runs through your phone now. So using even more battery. I still use an old Android 4.3 device for my route nav with OSMand it had removable batteries. When they die i hot swap them. And I'm on my way. With the screen off I can ride most/if not all day. Turning it on only if I'm unsure or want to verify.\n\nNo, for me, I'll keep my phone for grab shots, backup nav and communications. A separate camera for the bulk of the photos and separate nav for the bulk of nav. Redundancy is the spice of life.</span></div>","author":"Justin Serpico","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
