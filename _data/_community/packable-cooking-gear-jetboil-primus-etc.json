It is great.\nI am using surgical alcohol from the pharmacy, and it burns cleaner than most meths. I can only get 75% abv, but it works fine, it burns a bit slower but that is better for simmering and frying eggs.\nIn the past I had always liked the idea, but did not like the sheer size of the Trangia cooksets. They are light but, for me, took up too much space. The Trangia Mini on the other hand is tiny by comparison. I also carry a small round food box, a collapsible cup and bowl and a cutting board. All, except the cutting board, stash together, with the cup and bowl sitting on top of the rest of the cookset.\nRecently I have changed my setup. I kept the Mini's wind shield/pot stand and burner, but have switched out the pots to the Kovea Solo 2 pot set (minus the Kovea spoons and bowls). Including the folding the folding cup and folding bowl, it all packs down/nests into the pots, about 16.5 cm diameter by 12 cm tall. This is a comparable size to my Mini 28 kit. I changed to a two pot set as it suits how I cook better; although the Trangia mini is more than adequate.\nNote for Kovea Solo owners, I have just bought some silicon tubing online, to put over the handles as for some reason Kovea do not insulate them, unlike many cheaper pot sets.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/packable-cooking-gear-jetboil-primus-etc/image_1658056763_3689360924.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Mark Perry","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_980918","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Addendum, here is the modified set up I am using now.

The stove has a bigger burner, and becuase it sits on the ground it is more stable and it is harder to topple over with a pot of food on it. With the adapter I can use regular screw fit canister (camping gaz type) gas or I can use the adapter to fuel from butane cassettes (that look more like a household aersol can) that are much cheaper.
