I'm just wondering if I'm possibly setting myself up for potential knee injuries from the longer cranks, or if the relaxed frame geometry of the tourer somehow negates this. I suppose I'll know more once I can take the 520 out for longer rides, but if anyone has any experience or knowledge with this sort of thing I'd like to hear what you have to say.

(If your shirt sleeves are too short, a longer shirt body doesn't help)\n\nCrank length determines two things: where your feet will be at the top of each pedal stroke, and where they will be at the bottom of each pedal stroke. Changing crank length by 5mm makes a 10mm difference to this distance between top and bottom, so it's a significant change (just as significant as a 10mm change in seat height).\n\nIf you can't find a bike fitter that you trust, you'll need to rely on your own assessment and instinct, and YouTube can really help. I'm 180cm tall and ride 172.5mm cranks and that's perfect for me but as mentioned above it's your inside leg measurement that's the critical measurement here.\n\nUltimately if you are comfortable on the bike, no joint ache or saddle soreness, you've got it right.
