The setup should be no more than 1.5 KG in weight in total and should be compact.\n\nCurrently, I have the tent Naturehike Mongar 2, which is great, but the weight is around 2 KG and not so compact. <b>The main concern is the ability to put your setup for sleeping in most places, even those, where tents are not allowed officially.\n</b>\nIf your setup is lightweight and no more the 1.5 KG - please share. I know there is a lot of discussion witch setup is better, some like hammocks, some like bivvy with a tent, and others commit to traditional tents. I never tried the bivvy/tent setup and hammock either. I want to invest in a good lightweight setup, which I can use almost everywhere without worrying about legality, mostly for the summer/autumn/spring seasons. \n\nThank you.<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_album_attachment\"></div></div></i>"

For long bike packing tours, I always use a tent (big Agnes tiger wall) and for shorter ones I pick what will be best for the environment. The hammock/tarp and light tent come out to about the same weight I would say.</div>",

Much easier to pack on the bike. The tiger wall has a bike packing-specific model for instance. If u don't want to drop that much money nature hike do a cloud up 2 20d that is quite a bit smaller than yours for not too much. It is more cramped but I used it for a month from Stockholm to Austria with no problems.</span></div>",
