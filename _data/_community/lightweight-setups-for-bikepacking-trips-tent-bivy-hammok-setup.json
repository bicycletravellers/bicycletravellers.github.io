Setup should be no more then 1.5 KG in weight in total and should be compact.\n\nCurrently I have tent Naturehike Mongar 2, witch is great, but weight is around 2 KG and not so compact. The main CONCERN: is ability to put your setup for sleeping in most places, even those, where tents is not allowed officially.\n\nIf your setup is lightweight and no more the 1.5 KG - please share. I know there is a lot of discussion witch setup is better, some like hammoks, some like bivvy with a tent, others commit to traditional tents. I never tried bivvy/tent setup and hammok either. I want to invest in good lightweight setup, witch I can use almost everywhere without worrying about legality, mostly for summer/autumn/spring seeasons. \n\nThank you<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_album_attachment\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/lightweight-setups-for-bikepacking-trips-tent-bivy-hammok-setup/image_1655191445.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/lightweight-setups-for-bikepacking-trips-tent-bivy-hammok-setup/image_1655191451.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/lightweight-setups-for-bikepacking-trips-tent-bivy-hammok-setup/image_1655191459.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_374073","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_209890","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I have used all 3 in different situations before. If your absolute main concern is being able to wildcamp anywhere where you could not normally use a tent then a bivy is the best/only option. That being said a lightweight tent is still the most flexible and least affected by bugs as you can pop it anywhere and they are reasonably inconspicuous if well placed. Hammock is my fav for comfort and for watching nature from where I sleep but you do need those annoying trees üòÇ. Long bike packing tours I always use a tent (big Agnes tiger wall) and for shorter ones I pick what will be best for the environment. Hammock/tarp and light tent come out to about the same weight I would say.</div>","author":"Jon Belt","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_802200","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Jon Belt\"> thank you.

Much easier to pack on the bike. The tiger wall has a bike packing specific model for instance. If u don't want to drop that much money nature hike do a cloud up 2 20d that is quite a bit smaller than yours for not too much. It is more cramped but I used it for a month from Stockholm to Austria with no problems.</span></div>","author":"Jon Belt","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_338895","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Jon Belt\"> yes! That's one of the most important things - short poles! Right now I need to remove them from tent bag and put somewhere separately. When we talking about tents, one more important moment - tent should have ability to be installed straight with top layer first and after that - an inner layer.
