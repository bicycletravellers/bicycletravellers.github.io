So, if you want a bike for road riding and cycle tracks for the majority with a tour or two added on, then this will work (as highlighted above, it seems to lack pannier mounts). Youâ€™ll also need lightweight kit and sensible packing to achieve this.\n\nJust wondering whether it will take a rack or not actually. Iâ€™m not 100% sure a rack will fit even with being clever with add on bolt points. May be worth looking elsewhere if you want a rack setup, soft luggage (think â€˜bikepackingâ€™) will work fine though.\n\nWhereas, if youâ€™re main objective is to tour, then theyâ€™ll be better options out there. \n\nObviously a bike can be adapted to be used for a wide range of things before anyone points this out but you might as well get it close to your needs first time</div>","author":"Simon Bryant","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_746736","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Greg Curtis\"> I've done a three week long version of LEJoG with 30kg load, NC500 and countless unnamed heavily loaded tours, on something similar (an alu Raleigh CX), but with a rack. It worked a treat.\n1-3 nights you can do on pretty much anything. You could avoid having a rack by doing the bikepacking thing, or find a way of mounting it - there are various systems and workarounds allowing you to put a rack on virtually anything.\nAre you buying the bike, or choosing it? If the latter, I would suggest going for something with rack mounts, both back and front; simply to keep your options open. You don't have to use them if you don't do longer tours, but you'll be able to if you want.\nOther than that, CX/gravel bikes are my firm favourite as a go-to, 'one bike only' option for anything other than hardcore XC.</span></div>","author":"Pavel Bogolyubov","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_953545","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Just grab a cheap MTB and a rear rack as a 1st bike, it will do the job and give you an opportunity to see if it's your thing without excessive outlay</div>","author":"Robert Draycott","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_272943","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Hi so I'm basically looking at touring bikes on Facebook marketplace to buy... im bang on 6ft. So in-between medium and large bikes.  56cm is right but not many about..  most are 58 or 54. I don't know if 58 will be too big? \n\nThis is why I ended up looking at the giant contend AR as they have size M/L.\n\n<span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Pavel Bogolyubov\">  <span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Simon Bryant\">  <span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Robert Draycott\"></span></span></span></div>","author":"Greg Curtis","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_66501","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Greg Curtis\"> If you're borderline size-wise, it's almost always better to go with the smaller size. It's a lot easier to adjust it up with a longer stem and bars with longer reach than the other way around. Road bikes are very sensitive to fit, and just an inch off may create a lot of discomfort. Having said that, if you need a particular size, it's worth waiting until something comes up. Going a size down is a Plan B at best. 'Having said that' no. 2 is that ideally you need to try it for fit first, regardless of what it looks like on the specs. I got a new one a couple of months ago. Was borderline, did the right thing and went for the smaller one. And you know what... Despite being at the top of the height range for it, AND the claims that it's got a more upright, comfort geometry, I still had to change the stem and the bars to make it rideable; and I'm not new to road bikes at all, so it's not just that it felt different.\nIf you're planning to have just one bike for everything, I would go for something like that, but with mounts. Gravel bikes are a compromise, but a sensible one. They are a bit slower on tarmac than dedicated roadsters, but not by a lot; and added comfort out-balances it on long rides - 100+ miles. I have done them on both, and what you lose on moving speed, you get on overall average. They can do up to medium off-road - something with 'gravel' the size up to about a baby's head (it's not that much fun at the tougher end, but it's possible). Touring-specific bikes may be better on tours, although I am not sure how. Never had one, and I am very comfortable doing 100-milers on a properly fitted gravel bike with full load, so I don't see the need; and they won't be as good for unloaded riding.</span></div>","author":"Pavel Bogolyubov","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_261422","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I'm bang on 6ft and my preferred size is 59+.\nI guess this depends on other measurements too (incl inside leg) and one's preferred position on a bike. \nI prefer / need the 'relaxed' / upright end of the spectrum.\nIf what you want is a bike for touring, and if you might want to include longer and/or camping tours at some point, I'd look for touring bikes. Designed to be able to fit front and rear pannier racks. IMO, the design hasn't been bettered. There are 2nd-hand ones out there.\n(In fact, I may shortly have a Dawes Super Galaxy up for sale as it is a tad too small / sporty for me.)</div>","author":"Jeff Humm","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_236684","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Jeff Humm\"> yep agree!</span></div>","author":"Dave Ansell","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_866361","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">If your going touring buy a touring bike</div>","author":"David Holden","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
