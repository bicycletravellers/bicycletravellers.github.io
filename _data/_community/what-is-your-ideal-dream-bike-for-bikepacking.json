As far as tents go. I have tried a few. You need to decide on what weather you will be camping in. If you are going for 1 or 2 nights in warm weather and no rain. Go with something light and don't worry about rain flies and footprint mats. Another thing to consider is free standing or not.  In other words do you need to steak down the lines to keep the tent tight and standing or can you sent this tent up on hard floors without securing it to the ground. I camp mostly in NJ, NY and PA so we are always in grass or dirt. That let me go with lighter tents. Less weight from poles. As you can tell there is more things to think about . This is where talking to locals of your area and stores like Rei come in. Rei has the best return policies.  Just don't abuse it. I won't give a recommendation for any one tent because I share a few with friends.  Depending on where we camp. I hope some of this information helps.</span></div>","author":"Anthony Newman","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_238856","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Anthony Newman\"> thanks!
