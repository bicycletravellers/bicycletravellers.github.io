The gain for a thief stealing my pannier with used stuff in it would be minimal. But the damage to me would be enormous...\n\nI do occasionally attach the panniers with a Kryptoflex cable to the bike. That will not prevent anyone from still opening them or cutting the Kryptoflex. But it prevents someone from just effortlessly taking the panniers.</span></div>",
