A light fast XC race bike will outclimb and in most cases just be outright faster off-road even on gravel tracks once the trail surface gets even a little bit chunky. Now of course if we're talking about a full suspension gravel bike, it \"can\" close the distance, and when the road surface is smooth be faster, but the only two areas really seperating the two is the tires being used and the (typically) higher gearing on the gravel bike. Otherwise, I am fairly confident that the MCR is heavier than my ProCaliber w/ XO1 and carbon wheels.\n\nRiding long distances on a MTB just requires some clever additions like running bar-ends inboard which provides a pretty decent hood position and a lockout on the fork. If you're only doing gravel, tires like the Vittoria Terreno XC, Hutchinson Skeleton or Schawlbe Thunder Burts are quite fast on road and off. They're just not going to be suited for technical singletrack without some finesse.\n\nAs far as the distance, it just depends on the person, terrain and bike....my afterwork quick training ride is 30k which is a bit of climbing, forest/farm road doubletrack, cobbles and a few slivers of technical singletrack. I am faster on my MTB especially when the cobbles (big gnarly things), farm doubletrack and technical bits. My average speed is 22-24km/h.</span></div>","author":"Josh Kebschull","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_899468","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Josh Kebschull\"> did you miss the part where I said ‚Äúin my opinion‚Äù? \nMy ‚Äúlight‚Äù MCR weighs in at 9.86kg with pedals, dropper post, pump, F&amp;R lockout, 3 bottle cages and Ultradynamico 700 x 42mm Cava Race tires.

I have much better power transfer with my weight over my legs and is more aerodynamic, which really makes a difference over 35kph when riding between different trail systems on big rides.

Sure one has dropbars and one is flatbars, but the geometries will largely perform about the same...it just depends on what the manufacture wants and what performance metrics they're trying to achieve.\n\nAs far as how it translates for you, it really depends on your experience and fitness level, but also the environment you're going to be riding the bike....if it's all mixed with road sections, techy MTB sections, long grinding climbs and fast punchy climbs where you're going to basically throw every type of situation at a bike and the rider on the course....a HT MTB is going to win out.....its just more versatile.\n\nFor a gravel bike to win out, you have to kick out the distance further on tamer terrain and keep the type of terrain relatively consistent. Also, it depends on what type of gravel race: Is it a multi-day unsupported race or a one-day variable length 40/60/100miler.\n\nIn the end, its a different tool for a bit different purpose. Of course there's more overlap than comparing a MTB to a road bike, but they're going to be faster in different areas. Also tire selection is a HUGE factor. You really need to know what the terrain is you're riding, and use the right tire for the situation.....or something that is versatile enough to be fast where you need it and grippy when you need it.\n\nThe difference between dropbars and flatbars is a lesser point of interest, and really comes down to personal preference. In general though, you're going to get more value for your dollar with a flatbar bike than a dropbar bike, and a flatbar bike will be more versatile, but the things that a gravel bike does better and how it fits into the market, it does extremely good up to it's limitations.\n\nI know I'm not really speaking in absolutes. That is because there is more variables and caveats that muddy the decision-making process. I can only speak on what I do and the experience I have: I ride/race MTB both XC and Enduro. I ride/race gravel. I ride and do club-sponsored one-day classics which covers most of the huge 1-day classics here in Belgium in road biking. I do a bit of bikepacking, but they are usually weekend get-a-ways. I own 3 gravel bikes 3 MTBs and 2 road bikes....also use to be a mechanic in a previous life......I believe I can say that I know my way around bikes.</span></div>","author":"Josh Kebschull","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_931102","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Yes.</div>","author":"Chris Bussiere","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_706652","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Pushing a 30lb+ bike with squishy suspension and knobby tires can be a slog.</div>","author":"Brett Jensen","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_597026","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I'd say it's more about your tires and handlebars than the frame geometry</div>","author":"Charles Kempf","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_150560","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Salsa cutthroat.
