Highly recommend these bags as starter kit . Have been using mine a lot over the last two years . A JOGLE trip , NC500 and numerous weekend trips ! The only bag you have to give a thought to ( measurements ) is the frame bag ! Just make sure it fits your bike . I'm absolutely hooked on bikepacking so am gradually investing in more specific ( to my needs ) kit . I really hope you find what you want and have ,as I have , life changing experiences ! It's so hard , exhilarating , beautiful , grounding , relaxing riding you'll do !!
