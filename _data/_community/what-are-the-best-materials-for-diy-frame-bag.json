The problem is with a bag that‚Äôs stitched together is that you‚Äôre always going to have potential for water ingress. I tell all my customers to use dry bags in their bags if they have sensitive equipment because no matter how hard you try, water will get in. \n\nAny questions feel free to drop me a message over at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mackworkshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mack Workshop</a> üëç</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FFfbFNhRaaGg&amp;h=AT2jbawf5TPgzwICgYXuj2cq_ooxKgc-Rww9oW9jt9rNMP0HcZjOQVmI23nhymeg37UPxxuGIIMtEw3FZwTKci6Q8Z1QS7CT7URTMQoPfqWVCOsJ7-C8qNF3aL2DkPzxKbakip3u15zOSdM&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FfbFNhRaaGg/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">How to Make a Frame Bag Template</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">youtube.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Jon MacKinnon","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_724747","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I made my own top tube bag for a recent bikepacking trip to Big Bend. I used ripstop by the roll and rocky roads. I bought lots of cordura, a yard or two of a few different types, just to get a feel for it. I made a cardboard template, then sewed a few panels to figure out if my ideas were going to work, then eventually made two bags that were finished to varying degrees. My third try was the bag I used on the trip, and it served its purpose well, very happy with it. Take your time, sew individual panels, work with different stitch spacing, materials, etc. Practice, a lot. Good luck!!</div>","author":"Marc Fuentes","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
