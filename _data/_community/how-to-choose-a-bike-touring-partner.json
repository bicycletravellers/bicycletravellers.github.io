I went on a bike touring trip with a friend, I first met him, he mentioned that he wanted to do a cross america tour, and I thought it was a fantastic goal. then over time, I noticed that he actually did it. He did the East Coast route, then he attempted to do Trans-Am route, then he put that on hold. and he decided to do the pacific coast.

We met up, and we went on a cycling tour. it went smoothly, of course there were some bumps along the way, but things worked out well. My advice, first check to see if you and the partner is compatible, for example, go on a camping trip (short one) and see how things go, any issues, any tensions, any \" button pushing\", any complaints. then if everything go well, then you go on next step, go on a bike trip (short one) and see how things go. if everything is good, then you and your partner can meet together to discuss the logistics and the supplies and so on. then go on that trip. also, make sure communicate with your partner, ie: any tiredness, any illness, injuries, whatnot, then work out a solution that works well. and everyone is happy about. then things will go well.
