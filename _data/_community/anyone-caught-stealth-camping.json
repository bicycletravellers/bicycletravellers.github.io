Our parents let us cycle 350 miles from Chicago to Rhinelander Wisconsin to summer scout camp. We did it three years in a row. 350 miles in 3.5 days, with all camping gear. We’d slip into the forest around six pm on the edge of the road in rural Wisconsin. The highlight was once spotting a bunch of big appliance boxes at the back of some business at the edge of a small town. Late and tired of pitching our two tents, we assembled an abode from boxes and put together a makeshift bike garage. Turned out to be more work then pitching two tents, but this was certainly more memorable.
