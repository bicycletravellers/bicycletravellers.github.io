Below that I'll put on my raingear but - and this is crucially important - you can't just pull on Gore-Tex on bare skin; you need some intermediate layer. Yes, some rain garments do have a mesh inner lining that's supposed to deal with that but, no, in my experience they don't work.\n\nThe key to understanding permeable clothing is that the sweat from your skin has to actually evaporate into steam BEFORE it reaches the outer layer. Merino wool or silk work orders of magnitude better than the synthetic linings of most rainwear. It may seem strange and counter-intuitive to wear a long-sleeved wool shirt in summer, but once you've tried it I promise you'll become a convert. It will take heat from your skin to evaporate the sweat so it can escape through the pores of the garment - and it will cool you down at the same time.

Water will always run down legs into shoes/socks unless there is a double overlap. Sealkin socks on their own are a good comprise, as as they get wet, they act like a wetsuit, keeping warm layer of water next to skin.
