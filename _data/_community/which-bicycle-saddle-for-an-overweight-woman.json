Her own saddle not being for sale anymore, she had her ‚Äòderri√®re‚Äô measured at a specialised shop and bought a new modern saddle. With the result that she had an awful pain after a while. She went back, could get it changed for another one with no relief. During a bike tour she went to a local bike shop as she was quite uncomfortable and just bought a cheap one, which immediately felt comfortable. In my opinion it was a rather wide saddle that I personally would never have advised.
