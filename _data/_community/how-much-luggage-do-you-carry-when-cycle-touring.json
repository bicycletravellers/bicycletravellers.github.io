They had 2 small dry bags on their forks and front ortliebs for their rear panniers. We then met another couple who joined our group. They had 4 large ortliebs each (front and rear) 2 ortlieb 49L rack packs EACH!! the 4 of us couldnt believe it and we ask ourselves what was in those bags. After a while the chap did ask if we wanted a full size tripod as he didn't think he needed 3!!!!! Then after a few days another tourer turned up and this on blew our minds he had a really light road bike with just 2 small front panniers on his rear, we kinda laughed a little at how he was going to get on with so less gear going through the Pamiers, we thought he was on a credit card tour what with his set up. To our amazement he has been on the road for 3 years he just needed less and less as the months went on. We also laughed a bit about his super light road bike until we came across sand and while we was struggling pushing our bikes he smiled put his whole set-up on his shoulders and and walked along with ease. The whole group got on well by the way and well all wondered just how each other got on with the different amount of stuff we all took with us.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-much-luggage-do-you-carry-when-cycle-touring/image_1655220053_5225834776.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Barry Warner","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_60007","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Hi Barry.

Personal and camping gear comes in at about 12kgs because I go for full size comfortable air mattress and thick sleeping bag and 2 persons tent, plus 2 clothing for 3 days.. it's my long term travel comfort.\nThrow in some food and easily I hit over 30kgs. I'm often ready to haul 40kgs if need be on long term trips and my daily target cycling distance is only about 60km a day... And despite what I carry and how slow I go, I always exceed my travel targets and see more and explore.\nSo yes, I understand the idea of weight, but everyone can have a reason I guess.... In my opinion, any weight under 50kgs for a long term Traveller, it's nothing</div>","author":"Kyagera Ivan","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_826680","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I think that about my own luggage, especially when riding up hills ...</div>","author":"Simon Lambourn","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
