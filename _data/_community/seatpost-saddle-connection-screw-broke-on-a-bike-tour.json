I was thinking that this situation would have sucked if I was far away as I don't carry a spare.  It's just not something I ever thought would break.  Now, when I go buy a new screw, I'm buying two and keeping one in the tool bag, just in case. \nBut, I'm curious, does anyone know of a way to secure the saddle to the post with zip ties or something?
