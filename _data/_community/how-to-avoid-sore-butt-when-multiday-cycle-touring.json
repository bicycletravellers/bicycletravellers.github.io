I ride a lot of dirt trails in the mountains.  So it all boils down to the type of riding a person is doing.  If you're on fairly level paved or hard pack, then maybe a recumbent will be just fine.\n\nAnother factor is the amount of maintenance.  Lots of long chain, sprockets etc., on many recumbents.  \n\nGet a good bike fit, find a proper saddle for the type of posture you plan on being in while riding aggressive vs more upright and make sure you have your seat bone measurements when you start your saddle search.\n\nIt takes a bit of saddle time before you can toughen up your butt.   Ride an hour or so each day for 4-5 days, then increase your ride time a bit.  Get off the bike and stretch, walk around and enjoy where you are at least every hour or so.
