Using more muscles to output 250W or whatever is more efficient than using fewer muscles.  Two very different things. On alog day's riding this really matters. \nThirdly -  had the subjects actually learnt to pedal correctly? It takes time and considered practice to relearn how to pedal with clips/clipless compared to flats. You also have to build up the alternate muscle groups being used. \nI can pedal with almost zero foot pressure through ball of foot, where the traditional effort is being done and still out sprint other folk, because I can pull up so effectively due to a LOT of good practice. Despite 'studies' showing this is supposedly not possible. \nFourthly, a 40km time trial with a high cadence is not representative of all cycling. \n\nBut crucially  of all this study has not about actually about using clipless or flat pedals. It's to do with pedal orientation and ankling technique and everyone was either clipped or using clipless. Dear me!\nIf using flats instead of clipless, then your saddle height and foot on pedals is also changed, which then alters angle of foot, so you use a slightly different biomechanical action. You need to compare those two different ways of pedalling properly to draw valid conclusions.

So whilst riding today I thought I'd do a simple experiment. So I used just one foot to keep pedalling up a steep slope  either using upwards pull on cleats or  just pushing down unclipped. Clipped in it was easy to keep going, unclipped, it was near impossible without other leg to provide the downforce and keep pedal turning past dead spot. Now obviously we use both feet to pedal, but I had more effective/usable power and most importantly the load was split between more muscle groups. Using four lots of muscles to output say 200w is better than using two lots of muscles, particularly when during endurance riding and it'll reduce lactic acid build up when doing sprints.\n\nAnd we haven't even talked about the benefits of clipless when riding techy/bumpy terrain.</span></div>","author":"Jeremy Lawrence","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_124034","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Jeremy Lawrence\"> where's YOUR links?\nHuh?
