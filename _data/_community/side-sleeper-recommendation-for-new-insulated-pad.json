This matress is self inflated and shy over a kilo the large one. the big advantage is that you don`t need to blow it humid every evening then it will remain fungus free inside.  You can have (therma rest NeoAir Xlite Isomatte) 425 grs. and 6.4 cm thick one but you need to blow it yourself (with a bag on the valvle) , less than 6 cm wont be as comfy.  If you need to block the cold from the ground there are some extremely light weight foam blankets coated with Alu on both sides and it doesn`t get wet. i use them as a foot print. you can see it on the pic below.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/side-sleeper-recommendation-for-new-insulated-pad/image_1655145589.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Jo En Pausa","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_98845","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Don JoaquÃ­n\"> beautiful photo.
