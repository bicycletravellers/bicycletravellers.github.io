I would miss my husband a lot if he was gone two months (we also have small children) but I could see the benefit to him on going on a shorter trip doing something he loved. Find out what are the easy things. Maybe he or she will say hey if you're gone for three weeks that's no problem, any longer and I feel x y z.</div>","author":"Maebh Murphy","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_642956","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Maybe try to do a bit less ?

For us, that's the healthy balance. \n\nTwo months is a big-ish chunk of time, but I guess the bigger question os why don't they want you gone that long? IS it that they will miss you (sweet) or something else (not so sweet)?\n\nWhile them tagging along is not an option- could it be an option for them to drop in halfway through for a weekend? COuld they meet you at the end? Etc? \n\nAnytime my partner has been away has been rough (mainly just lonely) but I support him doing fun things and when he gets back I'm sure to decorate the house for a big homecoming and can't wait to hear the tales of the road.\n\nEdited to add: for safety I have their itinerary and they check in regularly so I don't worry.</div>","author":"Lindsey Hamma","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_264742","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Plenty of Diamonds!</div>","author":"Doug Ford","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_222167","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Get to the crux of why they aren‚Äôt supportive.

I had another conversation with my partner about all of this and understanding it is something I really want to do, he was more supportive.

Led to a good conversation and he is now supportive of my bike trip.
