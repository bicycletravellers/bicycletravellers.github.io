Now ex.  But taught and trained by others yes you need salt replacement on big hot days.  Normal days not necessarily.  Depends upon intensity, climate, and food stops.  But balanced.  A higher rato of potassium and magnesium is also important.  Just salt will throw the system out.  And not excessive.  One of the anti dehydration products is good.  But that also balanced.  For most of us not crossing deserts a liter a day of a dehydration product is plenty.  Obviously offset with plenty of water and normal food.  An extreme day perhaps two.  One in morning and one late.  An extreme day being the exception.  I've been in conditions where I drank up to 9 liters in a day in 12 hours temperatures up to 35-38C and even then that rule of thumb worked fine.</div>","author":"Daniel Ellsworth","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_865427","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">If you're going through water quickly, it needs to have added electrolytes because in sweating out that much water you're sweating out the sodium, potassium, etc that you get from your diet.  If it's cool enough that you're going through water slowly, then you probably don't need to add anything to it.  Of course this assumes that you're drinking the water you need.  In really hot temperatures sugar is helpful too, both because it facilitates better takeup, and because it's a way to get fuel when you might not feel like ordinary food - for the mid-day hours of a summer ride I'm typically drinking gatorade mix with additional electrolytes added to it, chased by a mouthful of water from a different bottle to get the sugar out of my mouth.</div>","author":"Chris Stratton","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_464154","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">She died‚Ä¶.. okay years later aged 90 ( just the other day üòÇ ) üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ</div>","author":"Richard Bould","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_166283","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">good quality himilayan pink salt is a good thing.
