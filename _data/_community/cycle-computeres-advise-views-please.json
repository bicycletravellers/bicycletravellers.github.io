It only supplies very basic info such as distance &amp; speed &amp; time, of which distance is my fail-safe data for basic navigation in case all else fails.\n\nAfter trying for years to find an adequate combo of phone apps myself, I finally received a clue from Maudie of the Wheels To Wander world touring team about which free apps work from a phone to eliminate the need for a separate GPS unit with &amp; its own charging &amp; data &amp; weight &amp; bulk.  The trick is to use a combo of app(s) to plot with AND app(s) to navigate with, downloading a plot from the plotting app to the navigating app via KML file.  My favorite bike route plotter is <a href=\"http://<a href = \" http:=\"\" bikemap.net=\"\" \"=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BikeMap.Net</a>/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;BikeMap.Net (the free web site, not their app by same name).  My favorite navigation app is Maps.Me.  BikeMap.Net can generate a KML file of a plotted route.  Simply opening the KML file automatically opens Maps.Me &amp; imports - once unlike Google Maps which constantly redownloads the same data.  Maps.Me does no turn by turn voice commands, but shows the downloaded plotted route on the screen independent of where you are, so you can always see where you are on the plot or which way to go back to the plotted route.\n\nHere is a web link to Maudie's video showing this simple technique:\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzrnuDROHIw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzrnuDROHIw</a></div>","author":"Mike Dannheim","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_301719","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I have the Wahoo Element Roam.

The first 10 maps are free, but once you pay for the app all the maps are free. They're amazingly detailed. You can add your own updates to it. It can disable the GPS chip when the screen is off. It includes cycle routes, and can be configured to route you onto the cycle paths. You can configure routing for hilly, flat, or in between. \n\nI've used it through some 10 US states and 30+ European counties and NZ. \n\nNo need for a second piece of hardware.</div>","author":"Rick Steeves","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_851396","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Love my hammerhead Karoo 2.
