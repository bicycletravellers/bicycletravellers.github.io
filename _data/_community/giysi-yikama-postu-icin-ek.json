I have two sets of clothing - cycling and camp/sleeping. Cycling stuff, you just put on wet. Uncomfortable for the first ten minutes, but once you get going, it's fine, provided it's the right kind of clothing. It'll get wet, anyway, from rain or sweat. OK, it gets a bit whiffy in a few days, but who cares? If I have to take a train at the end, I put clean(er) camp clothing on.\nNow, camp stuff, and especially the sleeping stuff, I am very anal about keeping dry. If it's +5 or so, I sleep in my 'last resort' thermals - the last-ditch layer I'd only use for cycling if in dire straights. And I know some people dry their stuff in their sleeping bags, but I have almost a phobia of getting it wet, earned in all sorts of bad weather cycling, kayaking and hiking trips. The LAST thing you want if things turn rotten, is a cold sleepless night in a wet bag.\nThe thing is, if it's the UK we're talking about, there's hardly ever a chance to dry things once they're wet. It does happen, but prolonged periods of warm, sunny, dry weather are too unreliable, and you can't count on them. So I find it easier to keep wet and dry things separate rather than trying to dry the wet.</div>","author":"Pavel Bogolyubov","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_734005","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Pavel Bogolyubov\"> absolutely well said, it’s how we operated in Borneo as I said sir there up in the thread. \n\nAs long as maintain bodily hygiene no issue</span></div>","author":"Andy McMahon","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_433194","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Carry a little sring (comes in handy for all sorts) and a few pegs, wash in the shower with your gel or soap dry overnight if not dry tie to the outside of your bike, dry by lunchtime</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/giysi-yikama-postu-icin-ek/image_1659790692_3180200601.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Trevor Shaw","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_581814","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Trevor Shaw\"> How you finding your little camp chair?</span></div>","author":"Andrew Marks","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_238619","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Andrew Marks\"> never leave home without it...it's only a cheap copy from amazon but 3yrs down the line no problems...I didn't think when I bought it I'd use it much but it's much better than a sit mat or the ground.</span></div>","author":"Trevor Shaw","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_520118","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Trevor Shaw\"> Totally agree.
