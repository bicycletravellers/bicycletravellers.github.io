If yes, then you need to choose bag with proper mount + stuff like Wolf Tooth Valais, so that your bag strap don't hit the dropper entry. I use Ortlieb Seat pack size M, that's because it has one strap that's pretty high on the post. Combined with Valais I still use dropper, just with slightly reduced travel.</div>","author":"Marcin SowiÅ„ski","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_518485","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">The new ortlieb seat pack is dropper post compatible, no tail swag and pretty solid unit in comparison to the others.</div>","author":"Callum Walls","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_762119","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Wolf tooth also makes an adapter so you donâ€™t destroy your seals</div>","author":"Justin Merrill","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_116593","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Alpkit Exorail is a good piece of kit</div>","author":"Graham Minshall","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_434189","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">That all depends on the seat bag and your bike.
