I think he already said as much.\n\nI love the light weight of carbon but the feel of steel.  I hate the weight of steel now that I have ridden so many carbon bikes.\n\nFor a tour or more precisely, for my type of tour and how I treat bikes, carbon would be too much of a mental liability.  Since you seem to know about carbon you know that even in the simplest of crashes the carbon may or may not be compromised and a scan would be the only way to definitively tell the extent of the damage.   That isn't really an option while I'm touring.  \n\nNot that carbon WOULD fail but how if fails is my concern.  Steel bikes give a warning and a bit of a grace period.  Aluminum less so but still less catastrophic than carbon.  So my concern isn't that carbon isn't as strong - it is the mental debate that would rage in my head after a crash or drop.\n\nPlus, heavy duty carbon bikes generally go contrary to the reason I buy carbon bikes.  I want them light and fast, not strong and heavy.  My tarmac is fast but I would never tour on it. üòÖ</div>","author":"Stephen Lodewick","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_621474","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Steve Methu\"> Yep for bike packing</span></div>","author":"Asif Raja Punjabi Cyclist","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_575105","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Fully loaded carbon fat tire is not going to break.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/carbon-bike-with-luggage-for-long-distance-bicycle-touring/image_1655212082_8214271348.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Ernest Alan Tufft","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_69095","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/carbon-bike-with-luggage-for-long-distance-bicycle-touring/image_1655212082_553297247.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Peter Menich","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_909284","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">jsut because they fit does not mean it is a great idea</div>","author":"Michael Maetreya Pace","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_382827","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">If a carbon frame cracks in the middle of nowhere, and you have a small carbon repair kit, you are good to go.
