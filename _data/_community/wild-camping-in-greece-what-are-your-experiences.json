Just find a spot away from the road and anyone's eyes and you will be fine. Use cooking stove as it's faster and easier to hide. Don't leave any trash (please!). Don't camp on private land. Otherwise, camp!\n\n2. Bike shops might give you a box for free or sell it for a few euros. I never had a problem with it, just plan it ahead and dont leave it for the very last moment.

The bear came right up to our pop up tent ran its clawed paw down the side of the tent and then incredibly walked away towards our bikes which it proceeded to wreck. When all was quite we got away up to road but when we returned to our camp site, the grizzly had destroyed our tent etc etc. However we still cycled on and into Denali National park which is full of grizzlies. Our main mistakes were: 1. We didn‚Äôt enquire first re safe places to wild camp (this particular area was known for rogue junior bears) 2. We didn‚Äôt hang our food (coffee!) up high and so attracted them in. Definitely worth reading up and asking re the local dos and donts re the bears. Respect local knowledge a fine thing!
