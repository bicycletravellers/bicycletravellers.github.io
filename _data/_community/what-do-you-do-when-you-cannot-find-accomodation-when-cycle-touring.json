I woke up in the middle of the night to the loud noise of gunshots. I was shitting my pants. I could hear people from a distance, and what I assume was laughs, and more gunshots. I sat and started to pack, my intention was to leave asap. Were they drunk? Did they see me set camp earlier? Were they coming for me? Crazy thoughts ran in my mind. While packing everything frenetically, I suddenly stopped, thinking about how my movements would catch their attention. Or maybe they'd think I am an animal and they'd shoot right away. I froze. I still remember the feeling in my veins, I had never experienced fear like this before in my life. I found myself stuck in that situation, not moving, not making any noise, for what felt like forever. Worse night. I guess I fell asleep at some point, because the birds singing woke me up. I packed up and left pretty quickly, thanking the universe I was still alive. Biking away, I saw an orange and white sign down the road: \"Zona de ca√ßa\" (hunting zone).
