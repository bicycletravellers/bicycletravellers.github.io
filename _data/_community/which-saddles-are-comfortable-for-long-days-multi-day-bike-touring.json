I like the Swallow and slightly prefer the titanium to the steel. I am pretty sure I have wider than average sit bones. I notice that my brother goes for B17 and I assume that the swift would also work for narrower sit bones. my wife also uses a brooks despite me buying a whole range of woman specific saddles (barely used from Ebay). I have mainly avoided padded shorts/tights on tour. This contrasts with local riding where I use a range of modern saddles and padded gear. Of the modern saddles I prefer my Rido saddle from SJS. The design doesn't look comfortable but perches you high up. I would just add that doing LEJOG in 2017 on a very old and damp Swallow I did injure myself and took a couple of years to recover - so keep your saddle dry and keep it tensioned and if its wet wet wet maybe leather is not the best. Also even Brooks saddles dont last for ever. Incidentally I did rehabilitate the offending saddle - a fairly complex process involving heating the leather!</div>","author":"Neville Street","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_39818","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">WTB Rocket or Pure is well worth a look.
