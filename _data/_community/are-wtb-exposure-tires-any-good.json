I've used a number of different tires and like any ride really, it's all about how fast you plan to ride, the tires your riding mates are using and the weather.  In the wet, these get scary and trying to keep up with a rowdy group on a descent gets really scary in the corners.  In short, you can get away with these but be prepared to go slowly.
