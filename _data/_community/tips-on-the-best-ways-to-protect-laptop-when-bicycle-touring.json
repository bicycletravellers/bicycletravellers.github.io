I am worried about compressing it too much or warping it when packed in the pannier, on top of the usual worries about laptops. Would love your input!<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"post_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/tips-on-the-best-ways-to-protect-laptop-when-bicycle-touring/image_1655118638.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"

That protects very well, is light and cheap.  You can fix this with a rubber band or in a small bag.</div>",
