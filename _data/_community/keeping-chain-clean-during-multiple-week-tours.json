Just hand-back-pedal while wiping off the worst boogers with a paper towel, then re-oil it, perhaps before each day's ride.  The more often you oil it, the less oil it will take to re-wet it.  You normally don't need to spend more than a few seconds wiping, &amp; then a few more seconds oiling.  The whole process may be less than 60 seconds once you become proficient.  \n\nI would not again (though I did) wash, rinse, dry &amp; relube a chain except after some gritty catastrophe.  If you are really paranoid about chain wear, obtain a chain wear measurement tool &amp; use it frequently.  They're small, lightweight &amp; inexpensive.  Don't forget to change your (chainring &amp; cassette) teeth at every 2nd chain replacement.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/133859272462?mkcid=16&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&amp;ssspo=rdohvrffr0w&amp;sssrc=2047675&amp;ssuid=YH5WEKQ0SZ-&amp;widget_ver=artemis&amp;media=COPY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ebay.com/itm/133859272462?mkcid=16&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&amp;ssspo=rdohvrffr0w&amp;sssrc=2047675&amp;ssuid=YH5WEKQ0SZ-&amp;widget_ver=artemis&amp;media=COPY</a></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F133859272462%3Fmkcid%3D16%26mkevt%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-127632-2357-0%26ssspo%3Drdohvrffr0w%26sssrc%3D2047675%26ssuid%3DYH5WEKQ0SZ-%26widget_ver%3Dartemis%26media%3DCOPY&amp;h=AT1LokFR8rRyR8BfNv0cJMzqUtlHp8e0ZnrB84VSKgvgh9M9MnpOyPSUE8GIQAqewEIzFnf8cSPgdkpoU-wqIW9Fj6Sxp10YTOZRPabHgYpR5qDMvdvNyZzZmMthKRw1qcGuh2AJlZ8BR-x1yFSJDT9W1b4wmDyh4BQ&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/ungAAOSwK5thJmna/s-l400.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Park Tool CC-3.2 Bicycle Chain Wear Checker / Indicator Gauge (D) 763477001344 | eBay</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">ebay.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Mike Dannheim","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_514635","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Rag, brush and a little lube.</div>","author":"Jeff Glessing","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
