My near brother-in-law, Jack, has been there twice, cycling. And the Fijian people were super nice and very friendly.

I remember a story from my sister, about Jack saying that they have to be really pick up the pace as they were coming up on the village on a bit of an uphill climb.  Jack is a a very kind soul and if a village elder stop them he wouldn't be rude and he carried the rice because these people are not wealth. I met my first Fijian on my second tour of New Zealand (north Island) in Whangarei. It was an incredible positive experience and kava ceremony was involved. I went to this substantially an outdoor pub for a wood fired pizza and a beer (German Alt style) and I left with a very fond memory that I will never forget and it was all instigated by this one Fijian. He treated me as one would a close friend. It started with the Fijian, the pub owner/manager, this quiet respectful Maori (I really liked him) and, then, me. When I left, there was a whole lot of people crowded around our table. Your comment triggered that memory and the writing of this, brought the memory flooding back into clear focus.
