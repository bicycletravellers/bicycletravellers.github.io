Good news is that it's one of the parts of the world where theft is very uncommon. In western Europe it's a little 50/50 in my opinion. But most of those who do not like that you take the bike in to your room, often has an inside place where you can park it securely. Roadside hotels in Latinamerica usually allows it. But now always city hotels, where you sometimes need to talk a little to them to make them understand that you not not want to park out in the street.
