Too flexible and you can get a hot spot from local pedal pressure (hot foot) on a long riding day, as the pressure bearing area on SPD is relatively small. If too stiff its general utility for hiking off the bike drops.  I've found my Shimano XC-7's (stiffness 9 on the Shimano scale) a bit too stiff for general touring use. Many will be happy with stiffness 4, though I can get hot foot with that on long days. My personal preference for touring is stiffness ~6 - avoids hot foot, enough flex for hiking.</div>","author":"Ian Houghton","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_270121","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Joe Marganski I agree.
