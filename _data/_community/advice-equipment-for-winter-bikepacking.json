I prefer a wax base chain lube in winter since you don’t need to worry about mud. I make my own that has worked well. \n\nPack well and warm, but don’t overdo it. I started out with just panniers but it was too much weight for the floatation so I modified a trailer. A good reliable non-canister stove is a must (MSR Dragonfly is my favorite, unless I’m just boiling water and then the XGK comes out). Forget a water filter and just melt snow, so have a good sized pot. \n\nForget a lantern and just use a headlamp, but bring a book or something, I like movies on my phone with headphones. I agree on the pogies, and the Bar Mitts are ok, but others are worth the extra (I have 45NRTH). A solid insulating ground pad is better but takes up real estate.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/advice-equipment-for-winter-bikepacking/image_1658051715_5559711927.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Mark Courtenay","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_135342","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/advice-equipment-for-winter-bikepacking/image_1658051715_8164100001.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Mark Courtenay","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_349564","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Toss everything into a waterproof bag or trash bags.

Two fall bags and polar fleece top and pants should be good for 0°F. \nHat for head and no more than an inch of cheap closed cell foam and your set. Keep your boots in a bag inside your sleeping bag. \nTarps and ground cloth is fine, if tenting leave doors open or frost will accumulate in the inside. \nWhen it’s really cold I don’t bother with fires. Rain is your real enemy, I still use a poncho in the winter, better ventilation than any “breathable” material, and cheap. Because it gets dark early I am in no rush to cook and continue to use my titanium twig stove to cook/heat soup, etc. I do bring a flashlight but for meal prep I like my 1960s candle lantern. I use a cheap plastic sled to drag my gear in. \nYou will need snow shoes. (I’ve got 5 pair)\nI’ve camped in very cold temps -32°F in the 1960swith my crazy Dad and -42°f in Labrador more recently. \nPractice in your back yard - try meal prep first then sleeping. (I sleep on my side with a fist firmly planted under my chin to keep my mouth closed, to minimize loss of water and heat. (Mouth breathing makes me very thirsty) If it is very cold only my nose is semi exposed. I’ve tried the hot water bottle in the sleeping bag…big deal only stays warm for a while. \nIf you really like it you will eventually get a very warm sleeping bag, (mine is rated for -65°F and I’ve had it since 1967.) If out for more than 2 nights I use a vapor barrier liner to keep my bag from moisture evaporating from my body.</div>","author":"Dick Blomshield","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_254821","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Dick Blomshield\"> I've snow shoes but wouldn't have taken it into account.

At times it’s brute force to maintain a speed faster than walking. But it’s all great. On my bike I’m more for packing with low volume and don’t worry about weight. For time in camp to keep warm I spend most of my time in my sleeping bag, at least one of them. 9 out of 10 trips are solo, helps when I’ve got only two speeds —- biking and stopped wearing a sleeping bag, no fires and asleep by 6 PM. (I pack up, bike to get warmed up, stop for Breakfast, bike, stop for main meal bike, stop-snack and bed. I do the same when hiking, canoeing(flat water) or kayaking mixed flat water and up to class ll WW. I would not dare keep the 2 meal schedule this other companions.) \nBecause nothing spoils winter meals include plenty of steak, no eggs - to hard to cook when frozen. \nAnd I will repeat the a most important procedure is stay dry and boots in your sleeping bag. It will take literally hours to thaw frozen boots while wearing them. If you want to hear crazy, I’ve made winter speed runs on snowshoes wearing running shoes and gators- 14 miles a day.</span></div>","author":"Dick Blomshield","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_758632","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Watch these guys Finland videos.
