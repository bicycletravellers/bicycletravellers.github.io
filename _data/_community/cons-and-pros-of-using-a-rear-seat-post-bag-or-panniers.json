But if you need that muck space, you should get a steel bike which is designed to been used with rack(s).\n\nAnd honestly I do not think anyone needs so much space - I can hike with a ~18 L, 4 kg baseweight bag for 3 days unsupported. With gravel bags you can go up to 43 L (but comfortably 35L) - so it is a better option up to 1 week unsupported.

However they generally hold a lot more stuff and if you need to carry a lot then they are the best way forward. But that can also be a negative as if you have the space you tend to fill it with stuff you don‚Äôt necessarily need. Also depending on the mounting system panniers can bounce quite a bit over rough terrain.\nThe biggest thing for me is the balance of the bike. A rear rack and panniers is ok if it is balanced with some luggage on the front of the bike, but for me carrying the vast majority of weight just on the back ruins the handling of the bike and can also make it more likely to do a wheelie up steep climbs.\nGenerally for trips of a few days a saddle bag, frame bag and bar bag have enough space to hold everything you need, and prevent you from bringing lots of stuff you don‚Äôt need. Longer trips or heading into remote areas may require more stuff and it‚Äôs more likely that panniers and fork bags etc become necessary.</div>","author":"Edd Hunt","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_173564","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Edd Hunt\"> Yes‚Ä¶ and racks break, often‚Ä¶ when off-road.</span></div>","author":"Michael Cleveland","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_300272","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">For me, being 5ft, the pannier set up is easier to swing my leg over than a seat bag...and no room for a frame bag on my small bike.</div>","author":"Brandi Jackson Hodges","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_527370","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Brandi Jackson Hodges\"> same here!
