However, I have never heard of any accident related to them.\nI myself have come in contact with these animals rather often and, as it's the case with basically any other wild creature, you won't get in trouble as long as you are not actively disturbing them. They can get aggressive if you cross them or take them by surprise and they are with their young ones (protective mothers). But generally speaking, they will try to avoid you.\nIt can get scary camping in the woods surrounded by boars, because they are very active at night and you will definitely know they are close.\nBut yeah, it's not but deal.\nUnless maybe you are referring to some particular wild boar I don't know about.\nCheers</div>","author":"Alessandro Pizzocaro","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_309231","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Alessandro Pizzocaro\"> the boars in Hong Kong have been known to attack people in country side mainly bitting people legs or rushing them.
