I'm going to ride the TransAmerica Bicycle Trail this summer and although there is no real dirt section, I'll be going across Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming where grizzlies live. I thought I could get some solid safety tips from people who actually bikepack off-road.\n\nI'm specifically thinking about food storage as carrying a bear canister seems almost impossible, as well as what are the safety tips for cycling in Grizzly country? I will be carrying bear spray and I will make sure to not sleep with my food, but any safety tips or/and wisdom from previous encounters with bears are welcome!\n\nAlso, wondering if some folks out here have done the TransAmerica Bicycle Trail and know if it's common to encounter Grizzlies while cycling the Idaho/Montana/Wyoming section?\n\nThank you all!<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"post_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-do-you-prepare-yourself-for-bikepacking-in-bear-country/image_1655465047_6348752633.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_419296","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_525731","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Bear bags and lines are an option.

Here's my two cents. While it is good to be prepared, a bear bag or a bear canister is really unnecessary. Pretty much no one consciously employs safe bear practices while camping in Idaho, and it this is because bears tend to stick to the backcountry. The exception to this, of course is Yellowstone. If you're within a couple hundred miles of there, you should be a little more cautious and see what the locals are doing. The only time people bust our the bear canister, is when they are going into the backcountry. Basically, if you remain close to places with a fair amount of human traffic you're unlikely to encounter any bears. Of course there is always the risk of one smelling your food at camp, but even this is pretty uncommon. Most campgrounds are equipped with bear proof trash cans, and if you observe some basic safety rules (keep anything scented in a ziplock bag, properly dispose of your trash, don't leave food out and don't keep it in your tent) a bear encounter is unlikely. At the end of the day, if you're worried about bears a can of bear spray is probably sufficient. This is what most people carry on the Tour Divide.</div>","author":"Seth Thomas","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_360253","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Not the case in BC!

My suggestions which are by no means the be all and end all, but I felt comfortable with based on my research and discussions with other riders I met-\n\n1) accessible bear spray in a feed bag on the handlebars. \n\n2) nothing in tent ever including toothbrush, toothpaste, scents, drinks or food. Water is fine.\n\n3) dry bag and smell proof bags and 25 to 50 feet nylon rope. Put everything in the smell proof bags and put them in the dry bag, tie rope to dry bag and heave it over a 15 foot or higher branch, away from the tree trunk and far away from camp. Tie it off at base of tree. It’s not hard. It might take a few try’s. Put everything in smell-proof bags in the dry bag so food hopefully, can’t be smelled by bears when in dry bag up in tree. They sell everything on Amazon, Camping stores should be helpful too.\n\n4) eat away from camp and put food trash up in tree too until you get to garbage disposal.\n\n5) bears don’t like to be surprised. Singing or loud talk in areas you feel the need.\n\n6) don’t run from a Grizzly ever. Slowly  back away or stand your ground with bear spray in hand ready to use. Talk loudly in a stern and sure voice. “Go bear” back up bear”. Playing dead is an option of last resort, if all else fails. That would be after you empty your canister of bear spray at it and it still is somehow not deterred. \n\n7) learn how to use your bear spray. YouTube has good videos.\n\n8 ) learn to distinguish between a Black and Brown bear. YouTube will help. \n\n9) if there is a bear box at he campsite, you can use that instead of the tree method.\n\nI never had a problem. Saw lots of bears scat. Most folks never see a Grizzly. We saw five in Teton National Park. They unexpectedly came onto the road as we descended on pavement. It was shocking but it was also one of the highlights of the trip. It turned out to be bear 399 and her four cubs.

They can be very aggressive and you are much more likely to run into one or have one get tangled up in your tent cords while you are sleeping. I have ridden in brown bear, black bear and moose country. Never hard any really close calls with bears they always have ran. But moose is a different story I have had to run behind the trees several times. Last week had a guy go past me on a trail and push an aggressive moose. The moose charged, he tried to get out of the way. He got off the trail but didn't get his bike off enough, the moose kicked it with it's front hoof as it went by. I had a little more time and got off the trail enough so the moose just ran by.

NEVER run/ride away when one charges at you.   for food storage i used a bear vault. it worked but I think no bear actually came and tried to pry it open. hanging is good too.
