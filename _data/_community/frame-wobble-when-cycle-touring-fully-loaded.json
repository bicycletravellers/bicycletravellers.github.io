Just judging by the photo, you seem to be carrying quite a load on the front wheel which would definitely make the steering subject to many small overcorrections producing a wobble. My rule with bikepacking it to carry no more weight on my bike than I would carry on my back. For me that tops out at 50 pounds. I also try to keep the weight no more than 60% on the back and 40% on the front. I prefer 70/30 unless that extra weight is something I might consume along the day's ride such as water or food. You also need to balance between left and right. Overall, your bike looks suitable and I don't think a new bike would solve the issue. My advice would be to lighten the load and play with the distribution before buying another  bike.

Front panniers were half empty, right rear had clothes, left rear aluminum pots, a stove, fuel and the tent. I have very little more than I did when I only used rear panniers, but now it is in four bags instead of 2. Lots of people travel with four panniers. Biggest weight was water, 2 of 2L in the Blackburn Cargo Cages plus a 650ml bottle on the stem. No wobble when full and without the bags. I did repack the food to the rear and the clothes to the front and that helped a lot. Best advice seems to be to redistribute the weight so that it is \"between\" the axles. This makes sense from a physics model. I am getting a \"standing wave\" and putting those vibrational forces outside the nodes seems to be the cause. Closing comments. Thanks all! Stay safe!
