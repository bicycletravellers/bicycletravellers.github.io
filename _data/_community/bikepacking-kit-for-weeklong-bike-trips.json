There's a good video on <a href=\"http://bikepacking.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bikepacking.com</a> on what tools to carry.  Tubeless setup is key.  If you are going to be out there for a week, change out the sealent with race day sealent - it's only good for a couple of weeks but it's like cottage cheese and will cut down the chance of a flat by 60%.
