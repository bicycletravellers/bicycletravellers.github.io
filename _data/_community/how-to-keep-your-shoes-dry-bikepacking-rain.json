What ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù shoes are in actuality are buckets. What‚Äôs necessary to do first is change your mindset and accept that if you‚Äôre in wet conditions, your feet are going to get wet. What your focus should be on is how to get them dry quickly once the rain stops. This is accomplished in two ways: first, by having 2 backup pairs of socks, and second, by having non waterproof shoes. Non waterproof shoes will dry out relatively quickly. If you‚Äôre at the end of the day, great, let them air out, hang up your socks to dry, and let your feet dry inside the tent. If the rain stops in the middle of the day though, you‚Äôve got a different issue. Here‚Äôs where the two pairs of socks come in. The rain stops, you take your shoes and socks off and let your feet dry. Put on your first backup pair of socks on, put your shoes back on, keep peddling. Your shoes will dry out quickly because the interior is wicking into your dry socks, and the exterior is drying in contact with the air. Eventually, you‚Äôll wind up with dry shoes and damp socks. Switch out the damp ones for your second backup pair and voila, good to go. Hang up both pairs of wet socks off your kit while you ride and you‚Äôre back to where you started.</div>","author":"Justin Ammerman","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_428084","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Justin Ammerman\"> love this answer.

I‚Äôm in NW England so we know about wet feet. I wish these shoes were available 20 years ago. What a revelation. Finally warm dry feet! The thing with sealskins is that once your shoe &amp; the outer acrylic sock are saturated, either water will find its way through or their breathability is shot because vapour can‚Äôt get out through all the saturated cloth &amp; you still get wet and cold feet. When they do get totally wet, I put my foot in a river and it went over the top, they dry out faster than my freerider pros. You do need to wear them with trousers with an ankle cuff that covers the top of the boot though, or it‚Äôs pointless. Rain will run down the top. They grip as well as the freerider pros &amp; seem to have a stiffer sole than the none gtx trail cross models (like the FR Pro). Value wise I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that bad.
