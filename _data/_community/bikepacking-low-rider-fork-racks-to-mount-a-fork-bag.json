Fork bags seem popular but how to mount them?  My son has 3 bosses on his forks, I've got one, which goes right through the fork, plus 2 threaded holes at the bottom ...  \nSo am I right in thinking my son's bike will take something like <a href=\"https://www.planetx.co.uk/i/q/BAPODTFB/podsacs-tarpaulin-fork-dry-bag-and-rack-(4-litre)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.planetx.co.uk/i/q/BAPODTFB/podsacs-tarpaulin-fork-dry-bag-and-rack-(4-litre)</a> but I need a 'low rider' rack??  \nHow does adding weight to the wheel help the ride over bumps?  Seems like bad place for fork flex/suspension, even if good for stability??\nDo low-riders snag in ruts / cope with narrow paths ... I assume the bags take quite a beating?\nDo you use them?

You have a lot of options to choose from other than just low riders that may be better suited for off road, thereâ€™s lots to think about in these reviews! The Nitto M1 uses all of your mounts so is possibly the most secure.
