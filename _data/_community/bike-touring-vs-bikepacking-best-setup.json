Credit card touring and randonneuring are very lightweight, and randonneurring goes for very long distances, whereas adventure touring remote parts of the world is off-road and you can stop wherever you want, because you've carried all your food and gear to camp with you and that can be heavy or lightweight. For purists, bikepacking doesn't use racks, but the bags become so large they need internal supports and cages 9But, don't call them racks.). Frame bags have been around for a long time. Tailfin's bikepacking rack is just a rack that allows for rear suspension travel, because some people want to carry more than a traditional bikepacking setup. When I first saw bikepacking videos and articles, I thought bikepacking was called that because nearly all riders had on small daypacks for the gear they couldn't fit into their bags.  Since then, the only real difference I've seen is bikepacking doesn't use low rider front bags, because the bags are close enough to the obstacles (logs, rocks etc.) to get caught on them. However, adventure touring and world touring uses low rider bags under very similar conditions and seem to do fine. And then there is the subject of trailers...  To me bike touring, randonneuring and bikepacking, among others, are on a 3-D continuum/cone and is influenced by your bike, physical abilities and what you want to take.  The Buffalo Soldiers rode heavy single speed bikes throughout the western US under \"bikepacking\" conditions. The best set up when starting out is the one you are closest to having right now. You can fine tune what you like and don't like from the different bicycling disciples, just keep an open mind on what you can to use. I got ridiculed for using panniers and rear rack on a hardtail on a trip with \"bikepackers\" with rear suspension bikes, but a saddlebag on my bike seemed stupid.</div>","author":"Mike Kroeger","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_589849","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">A touring setup isnâ€™t as cool and on trend but carries more and is cheaperâ€¦.. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜†</div>","author":"Peter Atkin","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_951888","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Carry kit for myself and my 9yr old son with panniers (week long trip)</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/bike-touring-vs-bikepacking-best-setup/image_1658048645_4674573094.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Richard Record","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_556386","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Speed, manoeuverability, comfort</div>","author":"David Riddel","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_63911","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"David Riddel\"> Good work deserves. recommendation, knowing where to invest, what to invest in, who to trust and how to make profit can be very difficult as a beginner, but when you work with the right people, the road to financial freedom becomes a lot easier,Bryson Drummond has really been a great help to me on this crypto affair, you need the right guidance too, you can contact himðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ Bryson Drummond</span></div>","author":"Zeus Xspenxive","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_709620","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I am not in it for a suffer-fest while pedaling long uphill grades.
