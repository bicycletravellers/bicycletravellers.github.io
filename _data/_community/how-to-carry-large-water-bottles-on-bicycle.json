Filling it on the bike is straightforward but removing it from frame is easy. Hose/cap connection is a wee bit fiddly and should be given a light touch (although Andrew from Adventure Hydration says spout was reinforced during product development) Does require stronger suck than I'm used to with  Camelbak, but that's physics! Not an issue in practical usage, and bite valve works well keeping fluid at mouthpiece. Sloshing of fluid in reservoir is audible but otherwise imperceptible. Maximizes use of that frame space relative to bottle/cage setup, keeps weight as low as possible, and I didn't see any dislodged Cranktanks littering the sides of the track!
