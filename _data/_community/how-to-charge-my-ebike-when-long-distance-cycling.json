Free the better, low budget, low profile? Those were your words. If your gonna ride a bike that requires a battery maybe YOU should provide the means to charge like purchasing a 2nd battery. So by your post you'd pull up to a laundrymat and plug into an outlet (free of charge) and use the owners power without contributing 10 cent to the operation? I guess you wouldn't mind a stranger plugging into an outdoor recpitical at your house. Right? If a trailhead or locale offers charging, if a resturaunt (where your eating) doesn't mind, any scenario like that is ok with using their power then fine. Otherwise, furnish your own power and don't sponge off of others especially nefariously.ike I said, I know my post won't be popular but I'm ok with that. BTW , not an ebike hater.

I said nothing out of place. The author of the original pkst was on here several days ago with a pic of a heavily loaded and I mean a curcus load of gear. Several people commented and he took some offense. Which is fine. Today he oosted about acquiring free power for an ebike during a trip. HIS wording indicated means of obtaining without asking. \"Free the better, low budget, LOW PROFILE. Which indicates using a power source without permission. An example was a laundromat. He doesn't mention using the phacilities just their outlets. I don't care for freeloaders. And suggested bringing a spare battery or asking for permission. I  didn't reize toll later it was the same guy from ladt week. Regardless, people didn't like my reply which was not offensive, rude, nor nasty. It simply pointed out that what he was asking was not fair to a business owner. Taking a nickle or $50 worth of free electricity without asking is or should be illegal. Other people tried to justify the actions and find fault with my post. A post that was fair and follwed the rules. If I'm on a bike trip and want to charge my phone at a resturaunt I ask. If I'm doing laundary and charge my phone that's fair.

There's always some people or \"haters\" who get offended on behalf of the person concerned, even with reasonable constructive-criticism, verbally attacking the person. Those other people may be projecting, or it could be any number of reasons.\n\nRe the go fund me people, I'm not a big fan of those asking for money, and am skeptical when they say it's in aid of X charity or those who do the \"50/50 donation to charity and to the travelling person\" thing, I have seen <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/weleaf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WeLeaf</a> do this a number of times on their social media. I just think \"well if they're fundraising, they can do that at home, no travel expenses?\" If there was a reliable way to verify where the money goes, that would be great and may easier to be more trusting of fundraisers. One of the few travelling people I've followed who ever seemed genuinely involved in charitable work is: <span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"https://www.facebook.com/1bike1world\">\n\nThough it's appreciated if someone is fully transparent on where the money goes instead of them pretending to be charitable when it all goes to the person(s) instead.
