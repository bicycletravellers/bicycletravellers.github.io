The only draw back with using the dynamo via a rectifier to power the Garmin / whatever nav device you get, is that at low speeds you may get warnings that the external power source has been disconnected.

A dynamo generates AC that need to be converted to DC and have a usb stabilization to 5V. In theory you can get a maximum 600mA charging current after conversion, but 100% efficiency is not possibe, so, in best case scenario you will get a maximum of 550mA. In most cases that's below the power consumption of a phone with maximum display brightness. Also, keep in mind that output power of most dynamo is 3W at speeds that exceed 25 or 30 km/h. Riding slower means lower output power. And, another thing, some phones have a built in safety protocol that stops charging process if there are fluctuations in charging current.</div>","author":"Alex Ciopată","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_104483","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Solar panel and powerbanks.</div>","author":"Mariusz Weber","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_957333","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">New phones like iPhone use much more power.

The screen is the biggest battery drain.\n- Make sure that all the systems you're not using - wifi, nfc, bluetooth etc. are switched off if you're not using them. Or, even better...\n- Use airplane mode - this switches off all the phone's aerials except the gps. Your phone can use a lot of power connecting to a signal if you're far away from cellphone towers. Only turn off airplane mode when you need to use the phone or connect to the internet.\n- If you need to be available by phone but don't need internet, switch off the data connection.\n- If you need to be data connected, use your phones power-saving mode. This will limit the background data connections your phone makes.\n- Check your battery usage for any misbehaving apps that are draining your battery unnecessarily.\n- Use another phone for navigation. Ulefone, Doogee, Blackview, Oukitel make rugged, waterproof phones with over 10,000 mAh batteries that will easily last multiple days.</div>","author":"Tom Platts-Mills","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_325614","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Thank you all very much for all your answers, very helpful ..</div>","author":"Fernando Mendes","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
