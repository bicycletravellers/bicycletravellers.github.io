I also cook a lot so want something with decent usability. Options shrinking already, I know!\n\nI've recently been using the Firebox Nano which is ace for twigs and alcohol. It's meant to be usable with a gas burner (the Trangia style ones) but it's a nightmare to setup properly.\n\nHave a full Trangia cook set, which is the best in terms of functionality but is pretty big and heavy, also no possibility for burning solids.\n\nAlso have a Trangia Triangle which is ace for gas and alcohol but needs a separate windshield and no twig burning potential.\n\nAnyone found anything that ticks all those boxes? Also up for little hacks to adapt cool systems to different uses. \n\nThanks!</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_660544","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_456449","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Pocket rocket mark two, fast light weight</div>","author":"Douglas Woodhouse","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_275516","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Douglas Woodhouse\"> I've got a bunch of stoves, but only ticks one box (and gas is the fuel I use the least).
