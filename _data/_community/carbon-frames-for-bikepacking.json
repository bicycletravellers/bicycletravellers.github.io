I can’t weld aluminum, but I can manipulate composites. I’m sure an aluminum expert might say the opposite. But, of the 5 bikes on the proverbial bench today, I’d venture to guess that, if they were aluminum, 3 would be tossed, one would be waiting for (praying for) a rear triangle, and one would be ignored and ridden (potentially at its peril). In my eyes, it’s repairability is part of what makes it a great material to use for bikes. Now, to add clarity, the fact that these are here being repaired shouldn’t be misconstrued as the material being weak. Only one of them was crash damage (that would have left an alloy frame in the same state) and the rest were either car rack damage, transit or shipping damage, and bike stand damage.
