NEVER store a bag wet. If you accidentally store a bag compressed, take it out and shake it vigorously. If the down is very compacted try putting it in the dryer on no heat with tennis balls. If this still does not fully get the loft back the down may be clumped due to moisture and dirt from use and is in need of washing.‚Äù\n\nThe common advice from all of the manufacturers that I‚Äôve seen is the compressing down is fine.
