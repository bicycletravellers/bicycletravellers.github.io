I bought it used off craigslist. Had three gears infront and six in back. The seat was comfortable but I had to adjust the tilt and the distance between the seat and handlebars. I had racks in front and back. I had new tubes and heavy duty road bike 700c tubes and tires and a new chain. Had it checked out and  spiffed up before I left.\n\nYears ago I did long trips on a 10 gear road bike. Petaluma ca to big fork Montana and back and a 10 speed from New Jersey to Miami Beach and back . When I led bike trips for American youth hostels we did trips on three speed bikes. As long as the bike fits and is comfy and in good working order, it almost doesn‚Äôt matter. If someone can‚Äôt afford a snazzy bike that is no reason not to go on your bike adventure</div>","author":"Susan Niman","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_376331","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Depends... \n\nSurly LHT\nRivendell Rambouillet\nShinola Runwell</div>","author":"Myles Blackwood","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_247596","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">GT Tripple mountain bike (two cross country trips, got it for free totally makeshift) Just picked up a Salsa Marrakesh</div>","author":"Joe Iverson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_42435","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Anybody on a kona rove ltd?</div>","author":"Michaela Gabriel","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_74004","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"","author":"Anton Tea","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_52939","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">A bike</div>","author":"Andy McMahon","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_707318","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Salsa Merrakesh</div>","author":"Jeff Flint","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_304793","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">These days a Koga World Traveller E-bike.
