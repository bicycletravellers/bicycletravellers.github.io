I fly Emirates, the bike is free, but counts as baggage. You are allowed 1x bag/Box of 32kg max so if you can’t fit your gear into one bike box (some airlines don’t allow anything other than a bike in a bike box), you have to buy more allowance. It costs about $75 for an extra 15kg plus about $10 per kilo after that for each flight. With two stop flight, you need three amounts of that fee. Becomes quite expensive quickly. That’s my experience after filling up my passport and 70+ countries</span></div>",

It proved most useful on trips when I didn't spend time in cities and just cycled to the airport and packed up my bike. Also useful in countries like Japan that require the bike to be in a bag on the train. On long trips, I don't want anything extra so I sort it out when I arrive at my destination. Thick clear plastic or cheap tarps from a home building store work in a pinch. Lots of options.</div>",
