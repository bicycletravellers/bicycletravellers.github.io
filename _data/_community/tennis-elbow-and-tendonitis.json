Got a Bandage now and will rest the arm two more weeks. <br><br>My boyfriend and I have been travelling 7000km in 5 months without any major problems or injuries (touch wood). \nBUT since we had to disassemble our bikes for the first flight I am not in the ideal sitting position anymore because I developed a <b>strong pain in my left wrist</b> which I never had before. <br><br>My saddle is adjusted the same but my handlebars are not it seems. At first, I thought it was but then this pain started and I am trying to readjust it to the original position but I don't seem to get it right (I had to take off the grips and outer and inner bar ends etc. <br><br>&nbsp;Now I was wondering if I have pain in my wrist which is spreading all the way up to the flexor muscles (or the other way around). Do I stretch my arms too much or too little? Do I have to adjust my handles (Ergon gp2) more low or more up? \n\nI am thankful for any ideas :)<br><br><div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"post_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/tennis-elbow-and-tendonitis/image_1655105363.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"

Often pain can come from a pre-existing problem that may not have been noticeable before you dismantled your bike and just a few small changes have brought it to the surface. I had similar problems with my wrists as they took a lot of the shock. You can try a couple of things. If you don't already try wearing cycling gloves as they have padding, also bring your seat forward 1cm this will make your position a little more upright and lower the amount of weight you put through your hands. Hope this helps</div>",

        "text": "<div class=\"comment_text\">It’s impossible to diagnose your wrist problem from a distance, so by far, the best advice is to find a way to get an x-ray and/or an MRI of your wrist and go from there.  But if that isn’t possible, and given your approximate age, you may simply have inflammation of the wrist due to overuse—it’s fairly common.  Icing the wrist can be helpful, taking a few weeks off from cycling can be helpful, and there are also strong anti-inflammatories like those one-week daily steroid packs which can dramatically reduce inflammation and are often available in the developing world at pharmacies without a prescription.</div>",

I think your friend has a tilted handlebar. I send a photo of a small solution, the Flowgrip. Watch the angles in the wrist, marked in green and red.

Rather rapidly. Be careful. Not too far! Maybe 5-10cm upwards to the chin. Make sure your right leg is long. You'll hear a clicking sound on your left wrist. And feel relieved. It is not bones, but that hard muscle that causes the sound, because it was stiff  before caused by forced seating position. You cannot injure yourself but it takes some courage. We in the army help each other. One goes position like described. And other one does pull the knee up in the direction of the chin. Try yourself out. Even that position alone should confirm you are on the right way. As you feel relieved. And then... Just pull hard the way described and pain is past. You are not injured. It is just uncomfortable.

Usually, one way is flat and the other way has a bit of rising. So not adjustable, just part of the design.\nEqually, even if you didn't remove it, note that you can and refit upside-down to alter the ride position, assuming it is an A head stem, that fits onto the top of the forks, not a quill, that fits into the forks! Hope that makes sense!\nI had awful pain in my forearms when I set off, I changed the bars to give me a higher shorter reach and it cured it straight away. Good luck</span></div>",
