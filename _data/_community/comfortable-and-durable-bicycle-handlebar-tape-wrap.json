You can get it on AliExpress or Lazada/Shopee if you are in SE Asia, I see on Lazada Singapore for $6. It's quite thick, 3mm IIRC and the hexagonal pattern makes it sort of grippy. Only negative is it gets stained from sweat (goes sort of white) but you can just wipe it off. It certainly surpassed my expectations.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.lazada.sg/products/gloryworld-1-set-elastic-eva-bar-tape-comfortable-honeycomb-design-handlebar-tape-for-road-bike-i2108704322.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.lazada.sg/products/gloryworld-1-set-elastic-eva-bar-tape-comfortable-honeycomb-design-handlebar-tape-for-road-bike-i2108704322.html</a>\n\nI have some Zipp CX tape that I bought at the same time that is meant to be super comfortable and was planning on putting on after this stuff but this stuff has lasted longer than I expected.\n\nOn my best bike which I never ride I have Lizard Skins 3.2mm, it's extremely comfy but everyone tells me it falls apart. It hasn't in my case but I don't ride the bike.\n\nI've had Fizik Performance 3mm on the bike I ride most for the last almost three years, about 20,000km. It's actually on the second set of bars as the first was wrecked in a crash. It's totally ratty looking at this stage and I do need to replace it but it was fine 10,000km in. It's comfortable, looks very good, only issue is it's not tacky/grippy. No issue if you wear gloves and I don't and it's not even an issue then, but I do like the more tactile grip from some of the other stuff. I think the Zipp CX will have this if I put that on.\n\nThe other thing I use is the Fizik Gel 2 stuff. Of all the gel stuff, the Fizik 2 specifically is the best shape, it's more spread out and fits more naturally.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/comfortable-and-durable-bicycle-handlebar-tape-wrap/image_1655744731_4069550880.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Ivan McAvinchey","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_82606","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Salsa gel cork is amazingly durable and comfortable.

I've tried a variety of different brands of cork tape including salsa and cinelli and haven't found particularly significant differences between any of them.  Cork tape feels good with and without gloves,  reasonably grippy...  I've used a variety of different types of tape as well as wrapped bars with just about everything else...  I've got 3 bikes with drop bars and all 3 have cork.  If cork tape gets dirty if gets marked  - washing doesn't matter because it's staying marked.
