You must learn to follow simple routines/precautions. When cycling be slightly louder than normal talk loudly, ring your bell, sing etc if you have any concerns at all.  In camp, tent or hut, hang all you have that had a scent in a bear bag up in the trees at night, food, deodorant, even makeup and medical supplies at least 50m from your camp. Wash and clean your teeth at least 50m from your camp.  Carry to hand a whistle, an air horn and bear spray, make sure you know how to use all three.  Finally urinate close to your camp so your human scent is there for the bear to smell.  The risk is real, but it is small.
