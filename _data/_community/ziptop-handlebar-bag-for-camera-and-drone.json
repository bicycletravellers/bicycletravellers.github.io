I'm using the QR pack on Sun whilst doing a job where I need to cycle very quickly between locations and am currently working out how best to pack kit for security and fast access. Drone already goes in QR bag, but I can leave a camera on outside of bag with just the  fast releasing strap to secure it. I'll have my Canon FF with wide lenses on my body. \nSo this is an EM5II with f2.8 80-300mm [equivalent] lens attached.  Bag is not fully packed at moment but there's plenty of strap length for more content in bag. That and a pocket camera with a fast 24-70mm lens is a great light travel camera kit - when I decide which least compromised camera to get. A few models are well overdue upgrades at moment.\nCamera/lens is very weather resistant so not too worried about odd bit of rain.
