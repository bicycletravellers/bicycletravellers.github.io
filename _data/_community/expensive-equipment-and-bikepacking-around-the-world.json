However, I would say with general precautions on your part your risk or vulnerability is low.  Key to all this is the general respect cycling travellers are held and admired too.  My basic advice would be never to display any wealth at all. You are a poor cyclist with little to your name. Make your bike and gear look old dirty grey and worn. In the end it’s just stuff, so if you are robbed let them have what ever they want. I’ve been robbed twice and persuaded them both times that money is all that is worth taking.  Carry a fake wallet with a few old cards and a chunk of cash in it. Give that, get it done and get out of there.  Most importantly think ahead, plan ahead, set up your night camp stealthily and early if you sense things are not right however keep riding, moving is your greatest protection.  Overall however keep it all in perspective this is not something to worry about. Go with an open mind, an open heart and a positive attitude, the world is full of beautiful places and wonderful kind people, but be street wise and in the  end smile be kind and play dumb if the chips go down.
