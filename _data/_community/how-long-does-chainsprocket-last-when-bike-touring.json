I've run through my last set within 2000km/2months and I find that bit devastating. I would have assumed I keep the parts quite clean and with neither too much nor too little grease on, yes I do go 80% in highest gear but I've done worse things with my previous bike (eg, setting off in the highest gear on full load) where a set of chain/sprocket lastet easily more than 15k. I'm riding a 90s MTB, it feels bit ridiculous to spend as much on parts every two months as the bike did cost me second hand in the first place, but if nowadays that's how short the parts live, getting a sparkling new bike wouldn't make much sense either? \n\nPic for attention from my last trip across Germany and the weekly ride to my garden<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_album_attachment\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-long-does-chainsprocket-last-when-bike-touring/image_1658311392_1015166161.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-long-does-chainsprocket-last-when-bike-touring/image_1658311392_5255776308.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_941330","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_406523","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I've got 15,000 km from a new cassette and chainrings.

If the drive rings are not in line with the cogs (even a couple of degrees out) the chain will not run over the cogs freely, but will rub on the sides.

Without seeing pics to diagnose I'll just through out some ideas.  1) You can check chain ring wear visually by looking at the teeth.  If they look like shark fins, replace.  I look at mine every time I clean my chain.  2)  Check chains with a chain checker tool.  You should be able to get several thousand miles out of a chain.  Check it every time you clean your chain.  I heard from a mechainic that 1x setups eat up chains due to crazy chain lines but haven't confirmed that personnally.  3)  Rear cassettes rarely need replacing if you take care of your chain rings and chain.  Just keep 'em clean.  Chains are about the most unfun of purchases so I hope something helps.  Good luck!</div>","author":"Mike Schlacter","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
