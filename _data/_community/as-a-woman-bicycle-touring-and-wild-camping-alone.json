From a \"courage\" to do it point of view I think there is little gender difference these days, but the stats I collect on my own and see from other sources all indicate that cycling is still a male dominant sport. Some 6-7 years ago my own stats were indicating about 19% of all cyclist were female. These days the number is more around 25%. So, while it is very likely most people touring solo are still male, the number of female solo tourers has likely increased over the years also. There is a growing number of couples touring together as well.
