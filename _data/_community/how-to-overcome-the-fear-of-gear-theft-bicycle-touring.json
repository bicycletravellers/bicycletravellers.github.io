So don't worry about your work experience, it's ok. Some equipment can be removed from the bike in a matter of seconds (lights, pumps, or computers, for example). The contents of some bags should be easily accessible - that's what they were invented for. Losing even a piece of equipment can be significant in terms of money and jeopardize the continuation of your trip at all. It doesn't depend on the country, your profession, or your trust in humanity - it just is. This is just the difference between trust and caution. \n\nI try not to leave my bike unattended even for a few minutes in a crowded place. If you ride in a group, someone can always stay with the bikes in the parking lot while the comrades are shopping. If, like me, you prefer solo - try to avoid big shops and malls. Small shop owners often don't mind if you leave your bike inside. On a long trip, I take a break every 3-4 days - to wash things, relax, and calmly do shopping while the bike is in the closed camping area - of course, locked and with the equipment removed.\n\nAnyway, if I must leave my bike, I use a lock and remove the most easily accessible pieces of equipment.</div>","author":"Andrew Pokora","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_691683","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">In 7yrs of using panniers almost every day, never had any such issue.
