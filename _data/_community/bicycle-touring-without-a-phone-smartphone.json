During that time I have cycled in at least ten countries. I carry paper maps, visit information centres and stop to ask for directions or local knowledge from random people along the way.

It makes it a lot easier to book places to stay (or just find them) and check the weather, for example. \n\nAnother benefit is when you get separated from your partner. This happened to us (1991?) and although I canâ€™t remember exactly which year, I do remember the fear of not knowing where he wasâ€”ahead or behindâ€”and he had the same fears. It was a remote areaâ€¦  Phones would have made it so much easier, if, of course, there was service.
