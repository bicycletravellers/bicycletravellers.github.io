I've slept on just a foam roll mat with the Jungle Blanket in a Snugpak Stratosphere without any chill in the summer. The blanket uses a good quality insulation so it's warmer than it looks. I simply wrap it around myself in the summer, winter months I wrap it around my sleeping bag to hold the temperature better. \n\nXL is massive but packs small, I'm 6'3 and around 15st and it's still plenty big enough to wrap around myself. My only complaint is it's quite a slippery material that can move around. The sleeping bag liner helps though and is good if it's slightly colder...
