I have a Sea to Summit Etherlite (10 cm thick) because I am a side-sleeper, and it's very comfortable and warm and super lightweight and comes with a pump sack, so no need to blow it up by mouth, hence no microbes and fungi inside the mattress and therefore it stays warmer because of dry air inside the mattress.
