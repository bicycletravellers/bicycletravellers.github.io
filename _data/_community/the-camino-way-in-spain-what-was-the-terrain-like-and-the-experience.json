There are a lot of alternative ways through the Cantabrian Mountains as well as the coastline, which is known as a pilgrim route \"Camino del Norte\", too. The best way is a mix of mountains and coastal lines. Of course, you'll climb much more than on the Camino Frances. For planning a route it's good to look at a map and select regions with natural parks or national parks. Even if you like to cycle the Camino Frances, you should take a look at routes to close aside there. Think i.e. for alternative route to Ibaneta Pass like the Col d'Orgambide, the Alto Sorogain or the Collado de Urkiaga.</div>",

You have to be careful with Google maps because they are inclined to send you down roads that are prohibited to cycles which is a pity because I find their directions a lot clearer than those on komoot.
