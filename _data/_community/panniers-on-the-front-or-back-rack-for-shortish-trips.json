A little move or shake of the hands and the front wheel and fork would swing left and right for a bit before it equalized again. You get used to it though. \n\nBefore my current longer tour, (8 months) that required 4 panniers because I got a new camera with a few lenses, I went on a few short tours while I waited. I just used the 2 new rear panniers I just bought. I liked having all the weight on the back much more.\n\nI now ride with 4 panniers with the front ones being lighter and balanced in weight (left and right weight about the same). Rear panniers are heavier and one is at leave 5kg more than the other but on the back it's unnoticeable for balance\n\nFor me, it's how it should be. For you, only you will know after you try.
