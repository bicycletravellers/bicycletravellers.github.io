If very relaxed and going short distances - 2 or 3 hours per days cycling - then larger pedals and hiking shoes are probably OK.  My wife and I use clip in pedals and shoes as we travel further distances at higher intensity, and like both the stability of being clipped in, and that we can apply power through the entire pedal stroke.  Thus, we also each carry a pair of running / walking shoes.  Total weight of the 2 x pairs of extra shoes is 1.4kg.

Myself and other long term tourers I met all ride with sandals. Those cycling shoes won't make much of a difference when you are pedaling everyday to different destinations at different distances - some short some long. They will only piss you off. They get hot, stinky (how many socks will you carry? Hand washing them every few days is a PITA and when you go without showers for a few days, clean or dirty socks both stink the same after an hour in the shoes), uncomfortable (being in them 10-14hrs a day is a pita when you will only do 4-6hra of ride time, the rest will be walked in these tight uncomfortable narrow shoes), bulky for storing, and are worthless in mud. They take forever to clean all that thick hard sticky clay mud off, especially in the hard to reach places of the shoe clips. You could carry running shoes with you but you'll soon realize you rarely use them and they just take up space. I put shoe rain covers on my sandals when it's cold and rainy. If it's just cold, I will put on socks - and I don't care if I look like an American or German tourists :) \n\nFor hiking etc. companies like Keen or Teva make good comfy strong grippy sandals. You'll find its mostly just Americans that buy those big bulky tall hiking boots because marketing tells you too - rest of the world hikes with whatever shoes or sandals they find comfortable</div>","author":"Adir Sharon","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_657593","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Think of it in percentages.
