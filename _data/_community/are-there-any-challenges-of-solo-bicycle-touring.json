And it’s gonna be fun lugging the dismantled bike plus the two panniers on and of etc. However as other posts say David O’Donnell the serious upside of this is that you meet gorgeous people like Benjamin and Ernest at Decathalon in Geneva, and a random stranger (Sean) helped me get the last leg back to where I am staying in Geneva.
