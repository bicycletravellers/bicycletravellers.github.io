I'm going to ride the TransAmerica Bicycle Trail this summer and I'll be going across Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming where grizzlies live. I'm looking for advice about cycling in bear country, especially Grizzly country.\n\nI'm specifically thinking about food storage as carrying a bear canister seems impossible, as well as what are the safety tips for cycling in Grizzly country? I will be carrying bear spray and I will make sure to not sleep with my food, but any advice or/and wisdom from previous encounters with bears are welcome!\n\nAlso, wondering if some folks out here have done the TransAmerica Bicycle Trail and know if it's common to encounter Grizzlies while cycling the Idaho/Montana/Wyoming section?\n\nThank you all!<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"post_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/bicycle-touring-through-grizzly-country-advices/image_1655745000_3611050956.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_519511","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_765382","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">If you bike is light enough you could strap your food to IT and hang the bike!üòÜ\nSeriously, looking at that rig, you could carry food in that frame bag and hoist it!üòç</div>","author":"Steve Haley","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_213703","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Great question.

Just be smart and research standard precautions for bear country. Other than a surprise encounter with a bear (aka blind corner) or getting between a sow and her cubs, grizzly bears will try to avoid you just like any other wild animal. Stay alert and make noise. They aren't going to hunt you down. Most bear attacks are defensive. Read up on and follow all standard rules for camping in bear country. BTW, a bear canister isn't designed to keep you safe and it isn't scent proof. Its simply designed to keep the bear from gaining a reward for raiding improperly stored food. Don't be afraid.
