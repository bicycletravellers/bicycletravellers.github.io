Earlier tonight I also pointed out your comment to my hubbie and saw from your profile that you are riding motor bikes now as well as bicycles. I too have noticed your name pop up in our mutual groups. \nIn June 2021 we had a house fire (we weren't hurt, but lost all 8 bikes in the fire + our car, camping gear, tools, lots of smoke damage through the house. We need a new roof and ceiling, some walls, garage and solar system) and we are gradually replacing the bikes. We are still in temporary accommodation courtesy of the insurance company. \nThis week we finally have touring bikes again as our custom Bike Friday NWT Silks arrived from the US. Very excited. Took them on their first spin today  We are planning to go back to NZ for a few weeks cycle touring in February 2022. We can't go away for any length of time while waiting for our house repairs to commence.

Glad material possessions were the only things damaged in the fire but of course, we imbue our possessions with our memories and experiences so often the loss is grievous Have not toured in NZ so am very envious. We are getting our Bike Friday NWT old work horses ready for eight weeks of touring in France. We are riding the La Francette cycle route and then thought we would ride to Tours and do 400 k’s of the Camino Sam Diego to Bordeaux.So happy that we are able to travel OS again. Has not been all calm sailing as I had a bicycle accident ( group ride ) had fractured my sacrum and L3 vertebrae, which put me out of action for quite a while. It will be a bit of a struggle to get back any fitness to prepare for the tour. I see the members of our old touring club out riding. Grown into a large group ! I have always had motorcycles in the background. My Facebook profile picture was, until a week ago, riding my Bike Friday round the seafront of Dieppe. Needed a little street cred in motorcycle world so changed my profile photo a couple of days ago! Are you still working in optometry?

I find the high highs and low lows addictive. You never know how a day is going to go and in an instant it can go from bad to incredible with the smallest thing. I also love the pace slower than a car but faster than walking and love seeing all the in between places and feeling like you are in the travel because there’s no windscreen you are experiencing all of nature and the weather. But the best thing is it’s strips you down to only the necessities and all you worry about is where to sleep, what to eat and how far to go.</div>","author":"Amy Collett","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_927748","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Amy Collett\"> that’s the stuff,</span></div>","author":"Douglas Eichhorn","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_382176","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Amy Collett\"> Well said Amy and its the people you meet on the way .Remember my wife Joan and myself meeting you both in France .We were heading to Denmark you were heading for Turkey .Great way to travel</span></div>","author":"Grant McKern","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_748890","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Grant McKern\"> yes I do remember!
