I have seen so many comparisons of 650b to 700c wheels, but they always (literally) are also comparing different width volume tires so to me that’s comparing apples to oranges. To get a true comparison of wheel sizes you have to compare them with the same size tire at the same “relative” pressure.\n\nPersonally I think the primary reason to change from 700c (29”) to 650b (27.5”) is if you “need” to. Through my personal, extensive, back to back testing with both size wheels with the same model/width tires, at “similar pressures” wider tires run lower pressures), I believe the the 700c wheels to be superior in nearly all instances provided you are comparing with similar width/volume tires.\n\nThe larger diameter circumference rolls noticeable smoother over rough terrain than the 650s. They also tend to carry your speed into, through, and out of a corner better when compared to the 650s. The 650s do feel quicker on tight twisty singletrack, but I don’t feel that makes up for the smoothness and speed of the 700s with the same size/pressure tires. \n\nThe most obvious sensation when switching between the 2 (with the same size tires) is that the 700s roll noticeably smoother and faster than the 650s and when switching to the 650s the first thing you notice is the bike feels lower (but that quickly goes away) and then it’s quicker on tight twisty trails. The thing is you don’t feel the lack of quickness with the 700s, and you don’t feel the lack of smoothness with the 650s unless you compair them back to back on the same piece of trail. Personally I’ll take smooth fast and efficient over quickness in most cases, and I spend over 70% of my time on singletrack.\n\nThat said there are times when switching to a 650b wheelset would be beneficial. \n\nI think the main reason to make the switch would be if your frame is limited to about a 700c x 40mm tire but can accommodate at least a 10mm wider tire in the 650b size. So in this example let’s say 700 x 40mm or 650 x 52mm. If this were your scenario and you rode primarily smooth gravel and pavement I think the 700 x 40mm would be the logical choice. Now if you primarily rode rough, loose, dirt, or technical singletrack where the added traction, quickness, and comfort of the wider 52mm tire would be appreciated, then the 650bs might be preferred. In this case (700 x 40mm or 650 x 52mm) you could go with either wheel size, or even both. \nIf your frame can already fit up to a 700 x 48mm or larger tire I would typically prefer that route.\n\nWhile personally I was all set on 29 x 2.0” (700 x 50.8mm) I recently converted the forks on my MCR to 80mm for the rowdier trails so I’ve gone with 27.5 x 2.3” front and 2.2” in rear. It’s nice to not tiptoe through the rocks as much as my wicked fast, but delicate Furious Freds. \n\nThe other circumstance in which I think the 650b wheelset would be beneficial is if your a “compact” rider on a small frame it’s the logical choice. It’s really tough to minimize toe overlap with a large volume 700c tire. Also the lower standover height and center of gravity is beneficial especially to the smaller riders.\n\nSo here’s “Jake’s Rule” - If you can fit at least a 10mm wider tire in a 650b than a 700c tire in your frame, you are a shorter rider, or ride more technical terrain, then 650b wheels are an option to consider 🐍\n\n* A special shout out to my “main man” <span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Ryan Nye\"> of <a href=\"http://speedvisionbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">speedvisionbikes.com</a> If you ever need a set of wheels contact him and tell him Jake the Snake sent you and he’ll take good care of you!</span></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/is-the-650b-slower-than-700c/image_1655838096_7106752309.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Mark Jake Jacobson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_372659","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mark Jake Jacobson\"> I could fit 700x40 or 650b x47.

I thought they’d be  a “once in a while” set and turns out they see way more miles than my 700s.  They are almost as fast on tarmac and much faster on single track, gravel is even imo.  Above all, they are just more fun.  Steering is quicker and they spin up faster making it easier to get back up to speed on technical stuff.

Ended up purchasing a Kona Rove LTD with 650b x 47 tires. I love it, even though most of my riding is on hardpack and even pavement. I have tires great for hardpack and pavement, Maxxis Minion Recpetor 650b x 47. I am plenty fast enough, even on pavement. However, I bought my Rove with two front rings 48 and 31, so it would function as a gravel bike and as a touring bike, with bags if I wanted too.\nI have four bikes, but the Rove gets ridden the most. The ride on the 650b x 47 tires is so smooth and dampens vibration and bumps.\nTire circumference matter but so does gearing. Calculate the gear inches that you desire for your possible tire decision and sprocket combinations to determine the differences.\nI spoke to another rider who bought two set of wheels for their Rove, both 700c and 650b but rides the 650b almost exclusively. I am lead to believe that 700c may roll a little faster in a given gear but 650b helps in quicker acceleration.</div>","author":"Todd McKinnon","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
