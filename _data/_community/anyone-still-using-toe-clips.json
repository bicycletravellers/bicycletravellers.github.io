The main benefit of clipless pedals is not and never has been the added ability of \"pulling up.\"  As the video states in a roundabout manner, our leg muscles are not designed to pull up well.  The benefit of clipless pedals and that of the older toe clips comes from the position of the foot on the pedal.  By keeping the foot positioned so that the metatarsal arch is positioned over the pedal axle and the foot is at the correct angle the rider can apply the maximum power to the pedal without any additional effort.  If you must use muscle movement to keep repositioning the foot on the pedal you are using the power that is not popeling the bike forward.  A component of the toe clip, which is not discussed in most of these anti-clipless pedal arguments, is the cleat that was nailed to the sole of cycling shoes of the day.  The cleat helped in maintaining the correct angle of the foot on the pedal as clipless pedals do today.  The angle of the foot is very important in preventing knee and leg problems from the application of power without proper alignment of the joints.  One of the major benefits of a professional bike fit is the correct foot/pedal position for maximum application of power.</div>","author":"Bill Heimann","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_238601","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Only on my Peloton.
