Just a few hours ago I meet a German guy who's riding on a bike he bought for €50 and has been on the road since March with no end date. A few weeks ago I met a 21yo kid from England. In Austria, while hitchhiking around the world, he was informed about retiring his thumb for a bike. He bought a bike for €100. A family I rode with for a few weeks all have used bikes (parents and a 9 and 11yo girls). A Spanish YouTube couple also are on bikes they got for less than $200.  My bike was on he expensive side worth $1800 but the company have me an $800 discount.. \n\nTrue tourers don't give a $#^@ about the tech as much. It's about the journey. Same about what we carry. I'm with a 55kg loaded bike. In the last 2.5 months, I put 3500km through the Balkan mountain Romania, and Turkey with +34,000 in elevation and did 2 days, each with over 200km.\n\nThose that buy the expensive bikes and UL gear are doing it because they can or because they believe the marketing. They usually do short bike packing trips or a once in a life time tour for a few months or 1 long trip per year based on the days they can get off work. They have the means. So what. It makes them feel good, or happy, or whatever the internal reason, it's theirs alone. Nothing wrong with it. \n\nThat said, technology is expensive to progress. R&amp;D isn't cheap. Prices go up because the market asks for it. That doesn't mean there aren't economical bikes out there. Som people ride old bikes their parents had or whatever sentimental reason. Again their bike, their choice.\n\nWhen I zoom by a roadie on the flats or pass bikepackers with less then half the weight I carry, or other tourers I ride with for a day or a few weeks, assume I'm a \"beast\". I'm not. Im just 170cm short and weight 68kg. Still have a beer belly. I just have a good drivetrain to help me climb up to 25% inclines and have been accustomed to it doing it daily with rarely any rest days. It's 20% bike, 80% mental. I can go and go until someone needs to stop. Expensive gear does the trick at the professional level. For the rest of us, those $400 clipless shoes don't make a difference. I ride with regular sandals and sometimes barefoot when I'm dripping wet.\n\nThose with all the expensive gear are divided into 2 camps: easy going humble people or asshats who think they are gods gift because they have the \"better\" gear. The later is a much smaller group and are usually roadies who don't tour, or some diehard bikepackers who try to reach the destination as fast as possible.. luckily, they are less common IMO</div>","author":"Adir Sharon","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_861202","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I've only purchased one new bike in my life, now a 77 year old.

I once had a conversation with a friend who is a bike fiend..(in a good natured way) and he loves biking as much as eating. He once bought a very cheap bike from Wal mart. That bike only lasted all of 1 year before falling apart. After that, he decided to prefer a higher quality built bike by Specialized or such like. So if you are a newbie, just learning to ride the bike, then yes, go for a cheap bike from Target or Walmart. but if you are a very strong and competitive cyclist, then I would think its better to buy a bike designed and built by a higher quality company. (I don't mean to push name brand, or push for buying expensive bike) Higher quality bike tend to have bike components that last longer and is able to handle the strength of the cyclist, and the speed that the cyclist can ride at. Just my thoughts. (The highest speed I ride at on my trusty Canadian made expensive and heavy steel Mountain bike is at 35 miles per hour.

Then if you want a bike with better components, save for that. I road an old Mongoose and thought it was a ton better than my Walmart piece of junk. Then I rode a Liv and realized what I was missing, so I saved for that. You are only competing with yourself and if you're happy and getting out there on what you have then enjoy yourself! I did a half century ride with a friend recently and I was the only one in regular clothes and shoes (no jersey or clips) with my lunch bungee corded to my rack... On a 20 year old road bike I found on Facebook marketplace. Who the heck cares? I still crossed the finish line and had fun doing it. I don't really mind looking like a pauper--it's good for building confidence in myself apart from what others think...

On the one hand, I think that spending on very expensive components with negligible return can be a bit silly. There are professionals, and they want the very best equipment. Other cyclists are going to want the same equipment as the professional cyclists, even if they don't really need it. Similarly, people buy performance cars that they can never fully utilise on a public road - because it's the fastest, or the most expensive. It's status oriented. They've spent a lot of money on their equipment,so maybe they need to show off to others that they have the best gear. I don't see why that has to be a problem. People have a lot of disposable income and this is one of the ways they use it. I enjoy rebuilding bikes as a hobby, and most of mine are salvage or second hand. I get alot of enjoyment and satisfaction from rebuilding old bikes, so if people are enjoying themselves spending thousands on bikes and equipment, why not let them enjoy themselves that way?! Be assertive about what you like, and allow others to enjoy themselves in their own way too. If someone is being rude about the cost and quality of their expensive carbon fibre bike, you can always just say that you think you see a scratch on the frame - and then cycle away! 😆</div>","author":"Bran Nno","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_998455","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Don't know what to tell you. Here in Austria, 50€ will not even buy you a second hand bike. And expensive bikes are often far nicer to ride. \n\nThis said, people are indeed crazy when it comes to buying popular brands. I understand it to a certain level, but quite often one can get something in similar quality for far less money if it isn't from a special brand. Don't get me started with cars or smartphones...\n\nFYI, I've been driving a 2-nd hand bike that I bought more than decade ago all over the place for years. Brand is \"ghost\", which sounds nice to me but otherwise has no real impact. Frankly, I couldn't care less if someone found it nice or ugly or \"not the right brand\" - what I care about is that it drives well.</div>","author":"Denis Havlik","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_713743","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Some poeple use cheap shoes, doesnt mean they are better for walking...\nI can use a 50 dollar bike if necessary but if Im making a 6000 km journey I have a much better chance of getting there with a bike costing a bit more.</div>","author":"Tommy Bäck","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_364596","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Who cares what they think?

I think the real consumerism (and waste of material) is that cheap junk bikes are being sold at all (and people buying them). \n\nI've seen so many people having their cheap Chinese e-bikes one after another. Or noname mountain bikes. I mean, crap bikes just don't serve too long. And because they are cheap no one bothers to fix them as soon as something serious happens, people just buy the next one 😖\n\nAnd at the same time I see people who use their old reliable mountain bike for 10+ years because it's a good quality and because it makes more sense to fix it and ride some more years than buy a new one. And I see people who have done pretty solid mileage on their e-bikes with Bosch (and other big brands') motors. And it's still possible to get spare parts, unlike with some noname products.</div>","author":"Alex Rybakoff","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_482016","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Bhai, you are coming under peer pressure and looking into too much social media. If you love to ride, just buy what suits your budget. \n\nIf you look into the car and motorbike industry, it’s the same. Be it the market, the social media or YouTube. All just wants of talk about the latest and best. But, do everyone ride the latest and the best. Just like imported cars/motorbike is more expensive. So is the case with bikes. Did high end cars and bikes ever was or is cheap.\n\nThen finally, comes our desi mentality, “Imported hai toh accha hoga.” Firefox did bring in a few models of road bike, but the market was like, “yeh toh Chini maal hai”.\n\nBhai, just ride what you can afford. Don’t come into peer pressure. People are doing Kanyakumari to Kashmir on normal Hero cycles. If show off is more important to you, then no comments.</div>","author":"Junaid Parvez","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
