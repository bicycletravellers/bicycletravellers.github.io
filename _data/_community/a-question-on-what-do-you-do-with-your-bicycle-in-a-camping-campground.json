Walked back to the hostel we were staying in and bought a 2nd-hand bicycle the following day and continued our tour along Eurovelo 15 (River Rhine). Luckily, all our other kit had been left in our room in the hostel whilst we were out for the day. If thieves want something badly enough, there is very little you can do to stop them from stealing it. The really big problem is how you can stop thieves from taking the kit off your locked and secure bicycle if you stop to visit any place of interest that you see along the way. I don't have an answer to that - other than carrying it all with you during your visit, which is hardly practicable.</div>",

This reduces interest for thieves!! Experience!! And chain it to trees, metal posts, etc. with steel locks!! The warning system from China is pretty good too!! But if you're far away you don't hear the sirens either!! And you need someone who can turn off the noise again, who could pay better attention to it... 😊</div>",

You could even put just the front wheel in your tent etc. I also have a lightweight cable lock for touring and rarely leave the bike unattended in more built-up areas. If I'm ever caught out without a lock I just make sure it's much more inconvenient to steal (disconnect brakes, put in difficult gear, loosen seat post, remove quick release axels etc)</div>",
