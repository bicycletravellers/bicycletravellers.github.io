It's not inflatable, and that's precisely what I like about it: no need for repairs or worries about it puncturing. It takes up a bit more space on the bike, but it's worth it. Previously I had a self-inflatable Therm-a-Rest one, but after a year it started losing air, maybe the valve, maybe a tiny hole somewhere. I started suspecting then (and looking for alternatives) when I saw that they were offering such products along with patching kits. The Z-Lite needs no patching. I use it even when I'm not cycling. It's my regular mattress (along with a sheet and other bed stuff that I normally carry with me) when I sleep at friends' homes or when I'm hosted by Warmshowers members (instead of having them waste time and energy making a bed, washing it all just for a night or two).</div>","author":"Ignacio Duran","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_407444","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Theann Faucher   Well, that might take some getting used to. I personally like sleeping on hard surfaces, it's better for my back. When I sleep on soft beds, I feel worse. I get aches from soft beds! The most important thing is that the mat insulates from cold and wet surfaces; after that you can put on more \"softening\" stuff like the sleeping bag, and I sleep with clothes (sleeping clothes) anyway, so that also acts as a \"softening\" agent. It's a personal preference, for sure, and might take some getting used to (or not) at first. To me it's similar to saddles; often people think a cushy bike seat will be more comfortable, but actually it's better when it's hard and smooth (like the leather ones, etc.) because then there is less friction, etc. It's not the same principle as the hard or firm sleeping surface; I'm just saying it's \"counterintuitive\" and takes some getting used to at first.</div>","author":"Ignacio Duran","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_718077","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Alpkit cloud base.
