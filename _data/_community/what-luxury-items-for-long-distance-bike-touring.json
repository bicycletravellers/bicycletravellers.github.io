That's it. Maaaybe spare cables.\n\nIf you are biking in Canada you don't need any of that other stuff and it is just dead weight. Duct tape is fine and could be useful I guess, but i've never actually used it for anything on tour. And if you need it, you can buy it in the next town you come to. What do you need a pedal wrench for? Are you going to carry spare pedals to swap out? Most modern flat pedals can be tightened with an allen key through the back of the crank. Why carry a micro cassette tool? Cassettes are something that wear out over time, they don't break suddenly. A fresh cassette should last you all the way across Canada and beyond. If you do need a new cassette you are going to need to go to a bike shop to buy one anyway and they will have a cassette tool you can use. I have absolutely no clue what one would use vice grips for? I've never used vice grips on by bicycle even when doing home maintenance. Bring what tools you can reasonably expect to use and leave the rest at home.</span></div>","author":"Kris Bjornson","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_60747","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Chris <span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Kris Bjornson\">   Pedal wrench for putting on and maybe off after flight(boxed bike).

You’re right, as far as bike mechanics go, they shouldn’t even be in the shop. Some thing is majorly wrong if you feel the need to use them. Either what you’re working on or yourself.

I  ruffed up the inside, added a lot of glue , waited to get tacky. Then used vise grip to hold it tight against the spot. Other wise I would be walking many miles. If the year or if puncture is smaller you can wrap a Dollar around the tube at that spot. . For those riders that never experienced this type of cut. You will repair tube and five miles or less it will fail. Also on the inside of the tire. Take your roughing patch for tube repair and clean the burrs . As far as bears in the previous comment. Racoons are the biggest pest. I don't use a Bear jar and use a waterproof dry bag. Just get some. Brut men's cologne or Old Spice. A couple of squits and I have left under my fly and never had the problem. In a heavy bear area spray the bag a couple of sprays and hang by cord.  Even squirrels will stay away during the daytime. They're not out at night. Always hang when in bear country especially in spring or on heavy traveled trails that the bears have been successful on raiding bikers bags. A note by using this dry bag in you panniers bags they will not have a good smell.
