The pressure shouldn't ever be that high. And supposedly this happened at normal operating pressures. The idea of high pressures causing rims to explode is a bit of a myth. The root cause is a manufacturing defect or damage to the carbon laminate.\n\nAlso, the stress on a wheel from air inside the rim chamber would be absolutely nothing compared to the stress imposed by a fully tensioned set of spokes. Most likely this is a poor bond between the bed of the rim (the hoop), and the aero fairing.
