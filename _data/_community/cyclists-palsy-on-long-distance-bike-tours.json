Can you take a beat and get a bike fit? You have got to be able to take pressure off of your ulnar nerve, which is responsible for feeling in your pinkies to middle finger and your radial nerve which provides feeling to your thumb through middle finger.

This advice is going to sound trite but really all of the advice so far is saying the same thing - do something different.  Change the fit of the bike, change body positions, wear looser gloves, wear more padded gloves, etc. I would say I am never in the same position on the bike more than 5 minutes so I might be an extreme.  Are your arms bent slightly at all times? Is your body pushed too far forward because your seat is too far back or your handle bars too low? Are you resting your hands and not gripping the bars too tightly? I would keep going and try to change things up and take breaks every 1/2 hour until I figured it out. First thing for me is to make sure my body position allows my arms to be slightly bent while I am in a comfortable tilt.  If your arms are not bent adjust your handlebars back or seat forward/lower (or both) until they are bent.  You might not have an adjustable stem on the handlebars so you might have to rely on the seat changes. I would keep trying minor changes for short periods.</div>","author":"Bob Kribs","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_495857","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Bob Kribs\"> carefully of lowing seat as you upset optimum pedal position and will then get knee pain .
