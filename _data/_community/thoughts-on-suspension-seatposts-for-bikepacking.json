You can read my full review  below.\n\nIt’s been almost 90 days since I put the PNW Coast seat post on my Grando and I have gone almost 1000 miles in that amount of time. While I haven’t quite got my seat adjustment dialed in quite yet (mostly evolving physical fitness levels as well as physical changes to my back and legs) the post itself has more than lived up to my hopes and dreams. With 100mm of travel, swinging my leg up and over the top tube with my bike loaded is a breeze while the up stroke of travel puts the seat right where I need it for maximum power and comfort. The upstroke is a little slower than I like at times, but it is super sensitive to the pressure of my bum and adjusts very easily to the Hight I am looking for.\n\nDampening is provided by a dual chamber hydraulic chamber with 40mm of travel which is adjustable by air pressure. PNW recommends 200-300 psi pressures for best performance and mine came shipped with 210 psi (IIRC), which Witt and I desired to leave as is for the time being. I have found this pressure is perfect for my riding style and comfort. I have yet to bottom out the suspension, even when I accidentally hit a mild drop out on the MTB trails. The suspension levels out the washboards very nicely on the gravel roads allowing me to maintain my fast pace without feeling like I’m out of control. Lastly on the road the post feels just as if I had a solid seat post allowing me to put the power down without feeling like I am riding on a pogo stick.\n\nPNW Coast Drop Bar Lever\n\nThere isn’t much to say for this lever. It’s a basic lever designed for drop bars. I opted for the larger 31.8mm so I could mount it on the flats. However they offer a smaller 24.5mm lever kit for installation on the drops. If I had to do it over again, I would probably try setting it up on the drops. I find it a bit awkward to go from the hoods to the flat to adjust the dropper post while trying to bomb a steep decent.\n\nPros-\nThe Coast Suspension Dropper does exactly what it’s advertised to do, and exceeded my expectations as a suspension seat post with the added benefit of being a dropper post as well.\nSturdy construction without compromise of extra weight.\nCost (it’s one of the cheapest suspension seat posts on the market and is relatively in line with middle of the line dropper posts\nBadging- I personally like the looks of the PNW Tree logo wrapping around the base of the seat post and the top of the Coast Dropper Lever\n\nCons-\nHeavier compared to a dropper or a suspension seat post\nslow rebound rate of the upstroke of the dropper mechanism compared to other dropper posts I have tried out on other bikes\nRequires a suspension pump with gauge to adjust the pressures properly for the suspension chamber.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, I will say this has been the best modification I have made to the Grand so far. It was definitely worth the money and then some. It has been a game changer for the way I ride and places I adventure to. Overall if you are looking for a good budget friendly seat post that is durable, offers some suspension, is easily adjustable, and is a dropper this is the seat post for you.\n\nWho said you can’t have your cake and eat it too?</span></div>","author":"Mike Rose","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_257959","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Jon MacKinnon\"> Love mine.
