I hope you are doing great!\n\nJust a quick question: **HOW DO YOU CARRY WATER, WHILE TOURING, IN THE SUMMER WHEN IT'S VERY HOT AND SUNNY? **Do you just carry your water in regular water bottles and let it become lava, or do you have a solution to maintain your water fresh?\n\nThe best solution I've thought of is getting some cargo cages like the ***Blackburn outpost cargo cages*** and strapping whatever insulated bottle you want that fits your frame. The problem is that the Blackburn cargo cages are unavailable at the moment in most sites and I don't have time to wait for them to arrive.\n\nAnother solution is using ***insulated bike water bottles***. I even had bought the *ELITE Iceberg insulated cycling water bottle 650ml** ***from *Decathlon *to try insulated bike water bottles, but I've found that they are not effective. In fact, they are a little heavier, have a lower volume capacity and don't keep your water fresh after 45 minutes. To the point where I don't really see the value in getting the insulated and not the regular ones.\n\nUnfortunately, I want to carry as much water as possible, but due to the frame bag I don't have much space left for bottles.\n\nSo what are your thoughts on the matter? How do you deal with the situation?\n\nI'm looking forward to your answers! Thanks a lot in advance! Have great rides!<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_album_attachment\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/carry-water-in-summer-when-its-very-hot-and-sunny/image_1655221468_1698071524.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/carry-water-in-summer-when-its-very-hot-and-sunny/image_1655221468_1131189558.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/carry-water-in-summer-when-its-very-hot-and-sunny/image_1655221468_7835251087.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/carry-water-in-summer-when-its-very-hot-and-sunny/image_1655221469_1324927758.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_147047","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_959383","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">backpack type hydration system/ handlebar bottle bags/ lower frame triangle water system</div>","author":"Edvarts Daniels Emersons","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_195735","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">fill a couple of water bottles 1/4 to 1/3 full and freeze them. when you set out for your ride, fill up with cool water and let the melt keep things refreshing. works for a while anyway.</div>","author":"Mike Bauer","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_590536","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Hello <span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mike Bauer\">!
