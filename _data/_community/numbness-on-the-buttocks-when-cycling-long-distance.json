This is my old review , but it still stands\n\nSpecialized S-Works 3D printed saddle review\n\n           *** IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ADDED LATE ***\nI forgot to mention the saddle rails are oval 7mm x 9mm. Depending on your seatpost clamp mechanism this saddle may or may not properly mount to your seatpost. \n\nHere is an account of my experience. First impression... Yeah, it looks bad ass for sure! And it better be all that and more at $450. I weighed it and it‚Äôs definitely light at 193g. Most high line saddles are in the mid 200g range with the lightest saddles weighing in at about half the weight, but that‚Äôs a straight carbon saddle with little or no padding.\n\nWhen I push in the padding in the sit bone area with my thumb to gauge the cushion it pushes in deeply with little resistance, and it‚Äôs firmer in the surrounding areas. I thought it was going to ride like a marshmallow... NOT. When I first sit on it, contrary to what I would expect, it feels quite firm, hard in fact, and for me personally it feels quite ‚Äúflat‚Äù. I think that‚Äôs because rather than higher pressure points under my sit bones with lower pressure on the surrounding areas, my sit bones sink into the seat instantly and spread out the pressure more equally to the surrounding areas.\n\nOnce I started riding the flat sensation quickly disappeared. It feels very firm, but without pressure points. The further I am into a ride the less I think about the seat. It just disappears from my consciousness. The opposite of all previous saddles where the longer I was into the ride, the more I‚Äôm thinking about the seat and the discomfort. Previously after 35, 50, 70+ miles my sit bone area would become tender and something I had to ‚Äúget through‚Äù until I completed my ride. So far My longest ride has been about 65 miles with NO discomfort what so ever. \n\nSo back to the price. Yes, it‚Äôs a lot of money for a saddle, too much in fact, but what‚Äôs it worth to you to completely get rid of long ride discomfort? They retail for $450, but you can get one for $385 if you buy directly from Specialized as a ‚Äú1st order‚Äù after opening an account with them. The most I‚Äôve ever paid for a saddle. That said I have more than that amount of money in saddles that are sitting on the shelf in my garage that I‚Äôm not using üòâ\n\nI rate it üêçüêçüêçüêçüêç</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/numbness-on-the-buttocks-when-cycling-long-distance/image_1662922126_6453724893.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Mark Jake Jacobson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_507691","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Ok...i get it.
