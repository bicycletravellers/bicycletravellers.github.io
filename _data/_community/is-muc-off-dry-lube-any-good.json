Big miles will require regular lubricant on the chain. Forget about dry lube unless it's really dry, every day. Imo wipe the chain down at the end of your ride or before you head off again, then reapply a good quality all purpose lube like Fenwicks or Halfords wet lube with teflon. Yes you're applying more lube on top of dirt on a long journey but it's the only way (unless you buy a Rohloff).</div>","author":"Stuart Leishman","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_211637","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Wet lube üëå</div>","author":"Amtrak Jez","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
