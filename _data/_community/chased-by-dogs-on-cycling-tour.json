There are 3 types of aggression 1) Those who approach you barking are the least dangerous, they see you fleeing and they will run away and bark but they will hardly bite you, in front of them just stop and yell at them and you will see how they go. 2) Those who are afraid will only attack if they feel in danger, it is very dangerous because they take it as life or death. Just walk away slowly, without turning your back on him, without intimidating him. This also applies to dogs that are defending their territory and/or livestock. and 3) Dogs that come running towards you without barking, these are very dangerous and will almost certainly bite you, they do it out of hunting instinct since they see you as fleeing prey. In this case, everything is worth defending yourself. I hope it helps you to be able to act correctly before the cute puppies.
