Just pour the oil on the moving chain, then change the gears so the oil is spread over the whole drivetrain. Vegetable oils are a miracle on rosty drivechains. Everything else takes too much time.

Not sticking close to plan but it still is acceptable. A bit noisy, though.\nWhen camping, it might be a good idea to cover it with something. In many cases, the bike can look like salvaged from the bottom of a lake, in the morning. Condensation can be heavy. But as long as it has a thin layer of oil, wax or grease (whatever floats your boat), it shouldn't have serious issues.\nAnd, after all, judging from the way you asked, I suppose you don't do longer than one week trips. So, having the bike maintained on a monthly basis will ensure it won't look like in the illustration üôÇ\nIf I were you, I'd be mroe concerned of accumulating experience instead of preparing.

We are on our second 'largish' bike tour (3 months) and have been thinking about the oiling frequency. Like others say it's not really a rust issue that we do it for (on a short term basis anyway) but I think more for length of chain life / reduction in friction etc. I find that the bikes need a drop of oil every 3-4 days of riding which is based on them starting to jump gears a bit (and the oil settles this down again so I assume it's the cause and solution but I'm no bike mechanic!!). The second important thing is the road surface... Sandy/ gravel roads seem to pick up huge amounts of sand very quickly which you can feel grinding away at the chain etc, so I have taken to pretty much a 'proper' weekly clean/ oil in such circumstances (less so if just on roads).
