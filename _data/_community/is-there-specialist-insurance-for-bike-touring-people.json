Stay Sure have a good reputation for dealing with medical conditions and do include touring as a covered activity provided you wear a helmet (ie if you had an accident not wearing one its down to you). As a member of Cycling UK you get a discount of 10% or 15% with Yellow Jerseys cannot recall which.
