Keep in mind though, that gas station pumps dont usually go to high pressures. This doesnt matter if you have big tires and dont need to go over maybe 3 bar. I would definitely recommend you to carry a pump anyway so whats the point? Most pumps can take both valves. And any bike shop I can think of has both inner tubes also. But I would also recommend to bring a spare tube, so even if you cant buy one at one specific shop you can still buy one later.. then most of the punctures you can also fix so I really wouldnâ€™t care about the valve. In any case if you still happen to be in a situation when a bike shop doesnâ€™t have a presta tube, you can still drill the rim then and there.</div>","author":"Viktor Spett","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_117532","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Viktor Spett All the garage air lines I've ever used go up to 6 Bar.</div>","author":"Joe Jones","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_151518","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Joe Jones\"> might be the same for gas stations, I am not sure of the exact value, I just remember it was definitely not enough for my road bike ðŸ˜‚ (8bar+)</span></div>","author":"Viktor Spett","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_930756","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">So many opinions!

So if you need new valve stems, or tubes, you might find it more difficult. Same if you ever needed a new rim on tour, it might take a bit longer to source one. \nUnless you are going to be running high pressures, it would seem more convenient, and therefore sensible, to go with Schrader valves, rim, etc. It also means that if you are your partner are both using the same size wheels, you can carry at least one less spare tube, and fewer bits in the repair kit (less stems, one less stem tool, fewer replacement valve caps, and not converter/adaptor for air lines).\nJust my 2c.</div>","author":"Mark Perry","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_982549","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Presta valves were a stupid invention.
