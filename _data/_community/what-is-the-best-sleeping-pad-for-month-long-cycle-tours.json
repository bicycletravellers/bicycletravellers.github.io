An inflatable and a short foam  pad with smaller pads to give it full length. The foam pads go under the inflating mattress to provide further insulation and loft, and protect from puncture. If the inflating mattress fails ( and I've been through at least a dozen ) than the foam mattress takes its place until I can replace it. A good inflating mattress will last a few years of constant use. A thermorest, about 18 months before it delaminates, or less if it develops many small unfindable punctures.. I use a Klymit now, which is fairly inexpensive in the U.S. They can last as little as 6 months or as long as several years. The one I'm using now is very comfortable and has worked well for two years of continuous use without leaking. I got it from Amazon for $50, and it's full length.</div>","author":"David Brankley","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_761235","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I took a blow up pillow and an air mattress a quilt and a 2 person tent.</div>","author":"Jean Phillips","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_17802","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I used a Thermarest neo-air on a year plus trip.

You can use a single foam pad in winter but I prefer to use both for warmth and because your pad will often get wet if you are camping on snow. However, on a long tour (months+), your inflatable pad will eventually break somehow, so I stick with the foam pad as it is basically indestructible.
