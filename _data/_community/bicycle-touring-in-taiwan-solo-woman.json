East coast is less populous , as suggested on the highways use the nice wide scooter lanes. Signs in English and Chinese on roads. People vey honest. Food great and not overly expensive.  I think it would be very safe for a single female. Great cycle lanes along the river in Taipei. Can use 7 11 stores to forward excess baggage etc to another town ( like postal/courier service ). Bikes permissible on local trains fully assembled and broken down on longer distance trains. A good ride would be top to bottom east coast and back up Rift Valley. Make sure to eat at local night markets.</div>","author":"Ross Mayberry","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_484817","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">TAROKO - For the brave.</div>","author":"Jono Foo","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_644105","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Jono Foo\"> we  cycle  from yilan up to lishan  in 3 days  and then riding down taroko</span></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/bicycle-touring-in-taiwan-solo-woman/image_1663613957_6145286584.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Marie Bardet","gender":"FEMALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_285133","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Taiwan is very safe a'd lot of nice landscapes and nice people üòâ</div>","author":"Julian Ripoll","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_575156","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Only ever been on business, to both Taipei and Kaohsiung.
