Like this one - this one cost me a couple hundred and most of that was for the gravel king tires.  Go to a bike recycler or even your local landfill might sell bikes they pick up.  Plenty of adventure bang for the buck.  Look for an old hybrid 'dad bike' and put some decent parts on it.  You build it and you'll be able to fix it when something goes wrong.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/buying-a-budget-adventure-bike-your-choices/image_1658052418_3171436267.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Chris Summers","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_693476","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">State</div>","author":"Dean Poshard","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_429866","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">State bikes all road was budget friendly.
