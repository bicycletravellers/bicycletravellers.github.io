Get wider pedals.\n- Elastic knee brace of some sort. Or those tapes on side of legs and knee...but that's pricier.\n- pedal slower, and on lower gears. You look like you're under 30, so you might be more likely to pedal harder, than use a concept I've read called cadence....getting power by using a lower gear and spinning the pedals round and round more. \n- more frequent  &amp;/or longer breaks. \n-take pain killers and anti inflammatory tablets. \n\nIf you were home and had more time, we could consider more things, like muscles balance, nutrition, crank length. \n\nAnd ultimately, it does need rest. And perhaps exercises to balance muscles and strength from foot to torso. Several knee pain articles and books by various coaches and drs say this. Soft tissue injuries are notoriously slow to heal and fix , and knee issues have contributions from feet to hip, even core strength. :(</div>","author":"Adrian Cheung","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_979997","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Roll your ITB as the problem may not be in your knee.
