They are waterproof though - I've run min under the tap a few times to get salty sweat out of the charging port when the phone has been mounted on the handlebars and I've dripped sweat all over it. It then takes a long time (hours to days) before it will charge through the usb port. A wireless charger has to used.\n\nSorry for the long post which doesn't answer your question. Hope it helps though.</div>","author":"John Burland","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_957200","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">iPhone with case and screen protector</div>","author":"John Smith","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_649500","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I'm very with my blackview, i sticked a quadlock adapter to it's back!</div>","author":"Xav Belisle","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_552762","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">My Pixel has been to South America 3 times and several tours in the US without problems.
