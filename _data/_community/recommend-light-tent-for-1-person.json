Will you be camping in mountains, or on lower ground. This will affect the kind of tent you will want, 3 season or 4 season. \nAre you new to camping? If you are then buying a cheaper tent makes sense. You might decide that what you need in a tent is different to what you thought you wanted when you bought your original tent. You might also decide you love it and want to spend a lot of time outdoors, then you can spend more. Or you might decide you don't like it and spending $1000 on a tent was not the best use of your money. \nWhat part of the world are you in. If you are in SE Asia it would make a lot of sense to buy a Chinese tent, as you will not be paying a lot for a tent imported from America or Europe.
