It looks like a lot has happened since your trip in 2016. Joe - I am mostly writing this to you, if you want some newer info on northern India. \nFirst of all the prices has gone up. A lot. For a simple room for a night, you will pay 900rupees and upwards. The most we payed was 3500 including breakfast and dinner. \nA lot of the roads have now been paved. Which means smoother riding, but also a lot more traffic. Manali to Leh is especially very busy. But also very beautiful. \nWe spent 6days cycling Manali to Leh. But I think it would be wiser to slow even more down. Especially the first couple of days, as we were not acclimatized well enough on Barralacha La, the first pass close to 5.000m. And once you get over, you end up in a valley where you cannot get below 4.300m. \nAnd a fun fact - every place can be spelled in a handful different ways, which makes navigating interesting. Some places even have 2 different names. So when comparing maps, and talking to locals, it is hard to find the places. But makes the trip all the more fun. \nAnd lastly - there are Dhabas and homestays everywhere. From Manali to Leh I wouldnâ€™t carry stove or tent. Even on the whole round trip we did in 4 weeks, we only used the stove twice and the tent 3-4 times. But not because we had to, just because we wanted to. In towns you can easily get some samosas or similar to bring on the bikeâ€¦\nAnyways - just wanted to give you some new insights. \nHope you do the trip next year. But be prepared for some really high passes ðŸ™‚</span></span></div>","author":"Kenneth Bruun JÃ¸rgensen","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_180969","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Kenneth\">, thank you. Great information! And nice to know we can get away without the stove and the tent. We're expecting the Manali-Leh road to be in pretty good shape but we've read lots of reports about poor road conditions between Shimla and Manali, particularly as the road gets closer to Manali. By starting in Shimla we should have plenty of time to acclimatise to the altitudes before we hit the highest passes. Three years ago in Peru we walked to 4700m without problems....... but there are no guarantees. And, as you know,  we're not getting any younger. Interesting that the prices are so expensive now. I hope the hotel for 3700 rupees was pretty special. \nI'll pick your brains over the coming months for more information.</span></div>","author":"Joe Sealby","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_833727","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Rachel\">, thank you.

It is beautiful and less spoiled. The roads are fun. But you know what kind of bikes we ride ðŸ™‚ \nJust wanted to be sure you are not planning on the direct highway, as on a bycicle itâ€™s not doable due to construction work and heavy traffic. \nSecond. The prices. Actually I lied. Our most expensive stay was 5.500 rupees. 900 is very rare to find. Average pricerange is around 2.500-3.000. Maybe you can negotiate 500 off. \n4.700 is high.
