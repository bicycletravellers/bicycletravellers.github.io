I'm simply putting this out as PSA for those, like me, who have to wear glasses when riding. A guy that worked for me had some, and in turn turned me on to them. These are the SMARTTOP Eyeglasses retention. You can buy them on Amazon for  just under $6 for a pack of 12. They are soft rubber, and can be reused. I bought two packs a year ago thinking id be going through them, but I'm still just using a few from the first opened pack. As you can see in my picture, they simply slip onto your glasses, and sit behind your ear. Because they are soft they dont irritate my ear while wearing them, and they are easily adjusted. I use to wear the Chums eyeglass holder, but they annoyed me, and sometimes would mess with my helmet adjustment. Again, I don't care if you buy them or not. I just wanted folks to know who might benefit from them. Admin, if this is not allowed, I apologize. \n  \n<a href=\"https://a.co/d/0MG1did\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://a.co/d/0MG1did</a><div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"post_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/smarttop-eyeglasses-retention-for-cycling/image_1658743281_4642025757.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_494868","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_552270","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I use something similar to ride too!</div>","author":"Rachael de Visser","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_921230","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I have these too and they‚Äôre great</div>","author":"Stuart Gascoyne","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_294919","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I still use Steve Martin's \"Opti-Grab\"</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/smarttop-eyeglasses-retention-for-cycling/image_1658743281_5418238736.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Chris Andrews","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_864396","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Chris Andrews\"> Did you ever receive your $1.09 class action lawsuit settlement?</span></div>","author":"Justin T.

I just don't like having the strap around my head. I've used these mountain biking, gravel riding, and backpacking. I've yet to have any issue with them slipping off, or allowing the glasses to move around. Plus, they're easier to pack away, and I can carry a few extra pairs in my gas tank bag in case I lose or misplace one. They take up almost no room, and for less than $6  for 12 pairs, you can't beat the price.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span></div>","author":"Kristopher Marshmallows","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_155472","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Just ordered thanks.
