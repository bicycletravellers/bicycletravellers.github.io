And no I did not own my home, I rented. My last job was in a tourist town called Jackson in Wyoming.  My rent was $450 a month. Working as a cook I could eat at work 2 meals a day, 5 days a week on a 8 hour daily shift.  The other two days a week I spent hiking and biking around the area.\nI began living the way I do when I was 21, a year out of the military in 1977. I began traveling by hitchhiking and backpacking. I took to bikepacking or touring as it was called in the 80s and 90s in 1982. My first tour was 2100 miles in 19 days, I was 26. My second tour was 7000 miles and I took 9 months to do it from Wyoming to New York, to Arkansas  to Arizona and back to Wyoming.  I stopped halfway in Arkansas to work the winter.\nAfter that I began working June to August then bike toured to get to national parks and wilderness areas to backpack. I basically lived in Wyoming,  Utah and Arizona most of the 9 months I traveled.\nYou say you couldn't live as cheaply as I do! Most could not with mortgages or monthly rent, auto payments and upkeep, families to raise, and all the self acquired debts to pay.\nI never learned to drive, only paid rent 3 months a year, never married, and never got into debt.\nThe most expensive thing I ever bought was the $1250 bike I now have, I live on just food and eat oatmeal, crackers, cheese and salami and pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner when touring. \nDuring the 3 months I don't travel I live in an apartment almost given to me by being a military veteran, via a program called HUD Vash. I pay just $226 a month on a $1445 a month place. The\n$277 a month I lived on was plenty to me. \nIn the USA  we have a store called Dollar Tree. Nothing costs more than $1.25 and I can buy enough oatmeal, crackers, cheese, salami and pasta to eat on for 4 weeks easy on $50 a week.
