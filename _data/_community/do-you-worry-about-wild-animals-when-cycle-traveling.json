Bears in America were similar.\nYou need to be aware of the dangers in these countries regarding animals, however, the ones that will annoy you must undoubtedly be bugs.\n<b>In Australia, my face looked like I had leprosy, due to mosquitoes, huge lumps appeared on my face, filled with pus!</b> Ants bit me incessantly, crawling up my legs, flies buzzing around me when I was trying to eat.\nI took to sleeping on benches at night in picnic areas, a lot of the time, to get away from the creepie crawlies. Then <b>I was warned about snakes in the grass, spiders, river gum trees that fall on you</b>  etc.\nThere are dangers and \nokay <b>I saw a bear in America</b>, and they can smell food for miles away, but you hope that putting food away from your campsite, up a tree etc, will help.\nBut the joy of seeing the wildlife at night, and the stars etc, makes it all worthwhile, or so I tell myself, when the truth is, I am a cheapskate. \nOnly once been found by people, a homeless guy, whilst sleeping in a boat, on a children’s play area, I assumed this was his normal spot. \nJust familiarise yourself with the dangers of each country, many countries have none, only people!</div>",

He was very mattered of fact when it came to dealing with bears all he carried was an air horn, bear spray and a 10 mm.\n    Was listening more about the things he did before camping, up to being at his camp, and the preparations he did before going to bed more so than what, when, or why he carried a pistol.\nWould I wear one in Alaska?
