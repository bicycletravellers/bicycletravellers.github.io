Especially when you load the trailer. And most who use a trailer overload. I think the problem is tunnel vision from both sides of the fence. Those that use panniers think it's the only way. Those who use a trailer expound endlessly on it's usefulness. I used a BOB on a few trips when my wife/daughter went with me. My normal  pannier weight for a 7-10 day trip/camping and resupplying food as intervals is 20 lbs or less. 10 per pannier or less. My tent weight /3 person Nemo is an additional 4lbs. I really didn't like hauling the BOB and it was a pain when stopping or go ariund/through obstacles. For you the trailer is a perfect fit but don't try and say your pulling a cloud.

I have an old BOB knock off but haven't used it much. I think the Burley Coho XC trailer looks like a good option.
