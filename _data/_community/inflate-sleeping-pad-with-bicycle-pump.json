My Klymit has a small hand pump that goes on a spigot. I ditched that and used an old inner valve screwed into a bit of rubber hose I had, the bore was smaller than the spigot so I used a drill to enlarge. No more breath moisture messing your R-value up. You'll be surprised though how many pumps you need to do, your lungs are quite large. \n\nI had thought I could do similar for a mat with a large plug using an old valve, a straw and some Sugru.
