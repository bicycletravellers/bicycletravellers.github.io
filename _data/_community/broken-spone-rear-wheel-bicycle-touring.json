The guy obviously knows his stuff regarding tandem wheels having a business specialising in tandems and by the sounds of it living and breathing it for many many years.  I just did a stock take of the two tandems that break spokes.  The lighter one that has the new wheel that just broke two spokes is 36 spoke.  I bought the wheel mid COVID and it was so hard at the time to get any wheel.  The other is 48 spoke but the bike is heavy (34kg) but the wheel made for it.\n\nThe article mentioned the importance of spoke tension - high and even and what happens if spoke tension is low.  I must find my spoke tension meter which is around somewhere and get to measuring the tensions on the spokes.\n\nI bet the new wheel spoke tension loosened as the wheel settled and some of the spokes got loose.\n\nApart from one of the bikes being heavy, the stoker is light - pre-teen or a young teenager and touring is only for a few days with camping gear but minimal food and water.\n\nI will give my wheels more love, especially my spokes and getting on top of their tensions.\n\nThanks for the article.  Has opened my eyes to the art of wheels and importance of spoke tension.</span></div>","author":"Aaron Davis","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_737094","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Aaron Davis\"> I know Peter White and have bought a lot of stuff from him.

You shouldn't need more than 36 spokes if you're using a strong, double-walled rim. I use the VeloCity Cliffhanger on the front and a VeloCity Dyad on the rear. When fully loaded, the bike weighs 150 lbs and I often ride it on rough double track in remote places with no problems whatsoever.\n\nSpokes usually fail on road/touring bikes because they're not evenly tensioned. Ideally, each spoke should have the same amount of tension as measured with a tensiometer. When the tension isn't equalized, higher tensioned spokes bear more of the load than lower tensioned spokes and this can cause the rim to want to deflect and becomes exasperated as the load increases. A properly built wheel will have spokes that have the same tension and the right amount of tension on one side of the wheel, either the drive-side for the rear wheel or the non-drive side for a front disc brake wheel. Most people think that a wheel needs to be perfectly true, but a little wobble is okay if the spokes are properly tensioned -- that's much more important. \n\nNevertheless, FiberFix spokes don't take up much space so I always carry two just for peace of mind.</div>","author":"Adam Tripp","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_240134","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Adam\">, Great advice.
