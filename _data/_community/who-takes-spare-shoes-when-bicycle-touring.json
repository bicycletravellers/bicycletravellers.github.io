If you are not touring in very cold weather, they also have the advantage they dry super quick. I have managed BRIEF spells even down to below freezing, combined with Sealskinz waterproof socks and shoe covers, but I wouldn't recommend this for where you know you will have significant extended cold weather, when I lived in Ireland I would wear them about half the year. I now live in the tropics and rarely see very low temperatures, so all year, I don't use anything else. These also aren't suitable for very long distance hiking due to the cleat being slippery, I bought some cheap trail runners for example to do the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal, that also involved some snow and wouldn't have been fun in sandals. But for day to day walking around they are fine, they are not super stiff and are quite walkable.
