I get a lot of  \"You're so lucky with your travels\" thing from friends/family and the like. but taking a year or so off to travel is not just the year travelling, you also have to take a year off saving, not going out, eating cheaper meals, and saying no to friends for that weekend away while saving is all part of the trip. Am I lucky to live in a 1st world country, I am indeed. Save save save spend return and save save save. Repeat. I chose years ago not to get married have kids and go down that road, never regretted. Next trip next year South America.....better get saving :-) I work as a cycle courier by the way so not a rich chap at all.</div>",

The majority of those we have met on the road don’t abide by the ‘normal’ rules and live life as they like, and nearly all do not come from a privileged upbringing by first-world standards. They just get out there and tour without allowing the ‘what if’ fears to get in the way…..what if it’s too hard, what if I run out of money, what if I don’t get a job when I finish my ride, what if I can’t afford the best bike and gear, what if my family and friends don’t agree with what I am doing.\nI cannot recall anyone asking us how we can afford to travel for so long without working, nor have we asked anyone. It just doesn’t seem to matter as long as we are all doing what we really want to and are happy and content with our lot in life, which is what I feel is most important.\nWhatever your circumstances there is always a way to go on tour, whether for two weeks or two years.\nA bit off the track of this discussion I know, but what the hell, I’m a contented, not-so-wealthy cycle tourist</div>",

And I am 52 now, making it 33 years that I have lived as a vagabond, only paused a few times, when falling in love with a girl for a while. I have never had any kids with the girls I have known though. Never had a mortgage. Never owned a car, or had a driver's license for that matter. I do not have a fat pension to support me and make me able to sit down in the country club with all the other old guys when I am old and grey one day. But I don't care. I have always fared fine. Even in times with little money. And I am a native of Denmark, where you get a little government pension, regardless of what you have earned during your life. My lifestyle has actually become a lot easier in recent years, with the internet and remote working, making things easier for modern vagabonds. So I run my own little tour leader business from my laptop. A job that also flies me around the world for free. And then I take my bike and my hiking boots with me and live the free life on the road, once the job is finished. I work roughly 125 days a year as an international tour leader. And that easily finances 240 days of holidaying as a tour cyclist and a hiker. That is of course because I live cheap when I am on my own. But at least I have a job that gives me mostly 4-star hotels to stay in during work. So I get my comfort about one-third of the year. Tomorrow I will be flying to Istanbul by the way, for a 5-day tour leading job. Life is great like this :)</div>",

I mostly work with major tour operators who deal with a +50 clientele, who wants to explore but do so in comfort. Being a native Dane, I work quite a bit with Danish-speaking clients, as we are not that many international tour leaders who have that language. But it's all connected. I will be working with a Turkish business partner this week as well, who will take care of most logistics for me. It looks to me as if you are from the US Joe. That is one market I do not deal that much with, as the business structure of US tour operators is different than in most other countries.

Cheaper than what a lot of people pay for rent. \n\nIf you subtract some of his costs like gear replacement, all his camera and video equipment, and health insurance, you get a total of ~20,000$. This averages to a cost of 506$/month. Very cheap in my opinion 🤷‍♂️</div>",

His bike and gear always looked beaten up and he didn’t have too much to travel on, but travel around, be it locally, he certainly did. I always thought his circumstances were because he was bone lazy, preferred collecting the dole (unemployment benefit) rather than working and wouldn’t know an opportunity to better himself if it fell out of the sky and landed on his face.\nI really need to call him tonight and tell him it’s because New Zealand was colonised around 1840 by the Brits. He’s going to be awfully relieved that he can legitimately place the blame for his tough existence squarely on the shoulders of those damn plunders who followed Captain James Cooks, the English explorer who ‘discovered’ that beautiful country in 1769.</span></div>",

Most people shy away from the concept of \"revolution\" as it's been given \"bad press,\" like the words \"radical\" (simply going to the root of a problem) or \"anarchy\" (simply having a populace that is so well educated that state power is no longer necessary). Instead, they are used as fear-mongering dialectical tools, such terms. We need a revolution (meaning simply a 180-degree, more or less, LOL) turn in our direction. And the \"axe\" we take to the task can be on many levels. Of course, some privileged parties, the elite, will object to anyone cutting their precious chains, the bonding elements of the socio-political-economic infrastructure they so much benefit from, but that is a given.

I got the bike as a present for my youngest son and his wife. I had just moved to a better apartment than I had before when I decided to go to COP26. By that, I didn't have savings. Fortunately, there are a lot of wonderful hosts out there, where I could stay during my trip. I ate as cheap as possible most of the time and was very lucky as well because ca. 95% of my hosts invited me for both dinner och breakfast. A lot offered me to send lunch with me as well - which I always said no to, but once (my host had already spread sandwiches). Sometimes I didn't find a host and I tried to stay at hostels. Unfortunately, there were no hostels everywhere.

Obviously, going on a long bike trip may seem expensive and just for rich kids. But I'd like to give you a slightly different perspective.\n\nFor context, I've been riding my bike for almost 10 months. Is it expensive? Not that much, especially if it's part of a lifestyle choice. Indeed, I sold everything. I don't have a car, an apartment, or furniture anymore... Everything I own is with me, at all times on my bike. I allowed myself a few plane tickets, but frankly, never for as much as it cost me to keep an apartment in Quebec City... That too has a cost!\n\nBut besides the very low cost of living that I have now, like others, I have organized my life to make it work. I have my own business, I work from anywhere, I earn my money in American dollars and I spend it in Mexican pesos. There are tons of ways to make money online or leverage currencies, but your way of looking at things is typically that of an... employee! In your world, the only way to make money is to exchange time for a salary. This means working in one place and therefore needing an apartment and everything that comes with it. Have you ever wondered how many hours a week you have to work just to pay for your apartment? That has a cost too...\n\nAnyway, I don't want to moralize, I'm sure you understand the principle: lowering your cost of living and increasing your income is the classic recipe for making a living.\n\nNow, if you're curious, I can show you a business model that allows you to live your life the way you want, whether it's on your bike or otherwise!  Just drop me a line in the comments and I'll give you access to training that explains how it works in detail. It's free, so it won't increase your cost of living ;-)\n\nI hope it gives you some insight. I wish you good success.\n\nSee you soon!</span></div>",

As for the bike, rarely have I spent more than 200 or so EUR on a single bike, often just 100 EUR or even less! Sometimes more, sometimes I've resold it when finished or donated them. And they work perfectly fine! So, for the past 11 years, I've done about 38 countries, some 48.000 km, working (language sessions via Skype, translations via email) and cycling at the same time. Sometimes I stay in one place for 3 weeks or even 3 months. My budget for many years used to be some 360 EUR/month. Now it's more like 400-500 EUR/month, including some flights (mostly over oceans as they are tough on bikes!) and including accommodation, food, bikes, everything. I do a modest, sometimes great amount of wild/stealth camping, sometimes hostels and a cheap hotel, sometimes I rent a cheap room. I do receive now (at 63) a minimum pension from the USA (just under $500/month), fortunately, because Covid would have made my life impossible (or simply forced me to scramble for other or more work). If you maintain a modest/frugal lifestyle and don't give in to the consumerist pressures of society, it's possible to live well on very little. Don't waste, recycle or make things last. I have just one pair of pants and one pair of shoes. I rarely eat at restaurants. Would the national/global economy collapse if everybody lived as I do? Yes, maybe, as consumption would plummet, jobs would disappear, etc, etc, but after a while, the economy would adjust to us to our lifestyles, as it should be and not the other way around!</div>",
