Wore open sandals. After seeing those pics, I switched entirely to closed shoes.\n\nThen, earlier this year, my ortho surgeon told me the story of a patient of his that wore sandals (flip flops I think) and she had an accident on a shared use path (families walking, joggers, slow biking, etc.) and she had a toe ripped off. To put it back entails months of bedrest.\n\nSo, it's not a matter of losing some skin which is no big deal. Toes and feet are incredibly important to mobility and quality of life. You lose a big toe and you will never walk properly again. Go ask a podiatrist.\n\nIf you insist on sandals, get the closed toe one from Bike Nashbar.</span></div>","author":"Wai Sing Lee","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_500019","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">What pedal/cleats are you on ?
