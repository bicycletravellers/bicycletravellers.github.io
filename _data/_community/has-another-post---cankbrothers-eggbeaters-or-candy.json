I currently have 2 pair of 11s on my gravel bikes and I’ve had a half dozen over the years, as well as one pair of Candys. \nIn my opinion simply, literally, the best. Easy entry and release, and the most mud resistant by far. As far as the straight beaters vs Candys unless your going to ride not clipped in or have really flexy shoes, I can’t see a reason to get the Candys. The Candys are harder to get into (only 2 sides), don’t clear mud as well, and weigh considerably more. \nI’ve had all “grades” everything from the OGs up through the ranks to the titanium 11s and they all perform virtually the same although for the hefty price of $450 the 11s are the lightest pedal you can buy period. I’ve never paid $450 as I don’t imagine they’re flying off the shelf at that price so they go on sale often. I just picked up a barely used pair for $225. They also make the Candys in a titanium model, as well as the Stamp (flats). But like I said performance is the same so if your not a weight weenie, cheaper ones are just fine.\nSome users complain that if they get a partial pedal strike and the pedal comes down on top of the rock, rather than the crank arm “vaulting” into the rock, it can release your cleat. While it does happen on occasion it doesn’t bother me and might even be a good thing. \nIn this photo in the sticky snot mud, with minimal fiddling my cleat clicked in with a muffled “click” 🐍</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/has-another-post---cankbrothers-eggbeaters-or-candy/image_1655828376_1233694883.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Mark Jake Jacobson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_578114","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mark Jake Jacobson\"> #wierdbike</span></div>","author":"Dexter Rutecki","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_21993","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Dexter Rutecki\"> WAF!</span></div>","author":"Mark Jake Jacobson","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_422957","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">my husband loves his egg beaters.</div>","author":"Tiger Paton","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_171379","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">One more thing be sure to use the upgraded brass shoe cleats.
