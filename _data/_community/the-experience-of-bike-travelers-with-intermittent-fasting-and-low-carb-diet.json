I know it is an odd question for this group, but because I think this way of eating could be especially useful for long, multi-day and remote trips, I opted this is the best place to ask \n\nI notice with myself if I bike some hours first before I stop to have breakfast I have the feeling I have moe energy, even before the breakfast. I noticed this before the intermittent fasting was hyped so I think it's not only in my head and I would like to hear other experiences with this.\n\nThe next part is influenced by the hype and some books I've read. Since some months I started eating as little as possible added sugar, even during biking. Before I started this I actually did the opposite, but now I have the feeling that eating a salad during the ride gives me more energy than eating special sports energy bars.

Based on my knowledge about nutrition and exercise, and complying with the probably best books about them: HOW NOT TO DIE(T) by Greger and EXERCISED by Lieberman, I recommend for the average person: - keep a daily fasting time window of best at least 16h. That means practically eat once or twice a day only - don't eat snacks around the clock - abstain from sweets with a high glycemic index  - don't eat at least 4 hours before going to sleep, better have substantial breakfast - complex carbs and plant-based food are best for health, fat-based or ketogenic diet does not work well long term, although it is best for treating diabetes initially. Additionally a longer fasting (at least 36 hours) might be done once a month. The very active sportsperson can of course deviate from these rules. So he can always eat a banana or so and eat three times a day, if a fasting period of 12 hours is kept.</div>","author":"Hans Grob","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_990584","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Hans Grob\"> it's not that absurd to ask, because most people call me crazy for doing that 😅 as you can also see from some of the comments.
