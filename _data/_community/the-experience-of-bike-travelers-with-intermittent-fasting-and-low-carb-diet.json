Oats nuts and dried fruit. Snack on trail mix. Have a mix of carbs and protein for lunch and evening meals. Try and avoid sugar-loaded food but find sometimes nothing quite works as well as a handful of sweets!\nFeeling hydrated is often our issue even tho we feel we drink enough.

At least, when doing sports, the damaging oversupply with glucose is nearly impossible, and the cell-repairing autophagy sets on or is increased. Based on my knowledge about nutrition and exercise, and complying with the probably best books about them: HOW NOT TO DIE(T) by Greger and EXERCISED by Lieberman, I recommend for the average person: - keep a daily fasting time window of best at least 16h. That means practically <b>eat once or twice a day only</b> - don't eat snacks around the clock - <b>abstain from sweets with a high glycemic index</b>  - don't eat at least 4 hours before going to sleep, better have substantial breakfast - complex carbs and plant-based food are best for health, fat-based or ketogenic diet does not work well long term, although it is best for treating diabetes initially. Additionally, longer fasting (at least 36 hours) might be done once a month. The very active sportsperson can of course deviate from these rules. So he can always eat a banana or so and eat three times a day if a fasting period of 12 hours is kept.</div>",
