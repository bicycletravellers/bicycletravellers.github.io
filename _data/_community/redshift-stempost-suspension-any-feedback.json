I had no problem keeping up until we got to the rougher surfaces, where I had to slow down and carefully choose my line.  I noticed several of the other riders were using the Redshift shockstop stems. They had great things to say about the stems and you could see that they were easily riding over bumps and rough spots that I was avoiding. My pride hurting a bit because of my struggle to keep pace, I bit the bullet and bought the stem and new gravel bars at the same time. Since switching I have noticed that it is much easier to ride on rougher gravel, washboards, over potholes, etc. The numbers support this as I am also riding much faster on gravel (2-4 mph) than I did without the suspension stem. Additionally,  the dampening of vibrations has decreased pain and reduced the persistent swelling at the site of my wrist fracture.  I highly recommend the Redshift stem. I use the 8cm, which is the shortest available.  I also use significantly softer elastomers than recommend.  This is probably due to the short length of my stem and that I make efforts to not put too much weight on the bars. I used the stem with both a Thompson carbon road bar and Ritchie carbon venturemax gravel bar. They both were great with this stem. \n\nI ride in El Paso and the gravel here is slower and rougher than I have experienced elsewhere.

I have to admit, the Redshift is a much much better ride and once adjusted, stays put due to its internal spring and adjustment mechanism.  \n\nThe PNW Coast on the other hand is a combination dropper post with air shock built in.  The thing is a royal PITA to adjust and the ride is not nearly as nice as the Redshift.  If you absolutely need a dropper along with some sort of shock, then I believe it's about your only option. \n\nThe Redshift has a magnetically attached cover that goes over the hinge.  It comes with a tether so if it ever falls off, you won't loose it.  I find that it sometimes rattles when going over bumpy stuff and I've thought of taking it off but haven't done so yet.  Other than that, I have no complaints.   You can adjust it so it doesn't bounce and it only compresses when you hit a pretty good bump.  You can also loosen the spring a tad so that it provides nice suspension over medium bumps and is still not bouncy.  Keep in mind that you have to pull the seat post all the way out of the bike to adjust the spring.  Thanks goodness, once it's set, it stays and you really never have to dink around with it unless you put on a heavy back pack or gain or loose a lot of weight.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is with any seat post suspension, it limits your ability to install bags that mount to the post and saddle frame.  \n\nNow my question is why is it called a seat post when a bike doesn't have a seat but has a saddle?</div>","author":"Norm Snyder","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
