I valued my free time more (to read, to sleep, to travel) than working the standard 40 hrs/week. So I reduced my needs, always sought out cheaper accommodation, etc. Of course, over the years I had periods when I worked a lot, even 60+ hrs/week (especially when I had my own business), or in \"corporate\" jobs, but in the end that never made me any \"happier\" nor did it change my lifestyle much. Once or twice I was able to live for a year or two years solely from my savings, but eventually I got back to a \"normal\" lifestyle/budget of 300-400 EUR per month, including the occasional flight, bikes, accommodation, internet, food, everything. For the past decade I've been mostly making that amount by translating or teaching languages via Skype. And now, with Covid, less \"work for money\" but fortunately I'm receiving (started at 62+) a \"pension\" (retirement benefits, so, some advantage from being \"old\"!) and that basically covers my budget. So as a young person, which I assume you are, my advice is: work hard at whatever jobs you can get, save money, travel with that wisely while at the same time investing or developing some sort of passive income (like renting out an apartment, or having some kind of business that doesn't require your constant presence, maybe with a partner, and you take turns traveling), and find some work that you can also do online as you travel (e.g. when I'm cycling, I often have to stop for an hour or two and connect with my clients during the morning or afternoon, or I'll work on translations from coffee shops or rent a room for a few weeks if I need to concentrate on a big job).</div>","author":"Ignacio Duran","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_823129","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Adrian Lancaster\"></span></div>","author":"Amanda Walker","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_355652","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Sell your trip on YT like most do, just one video a week and youâ€™ll have enough to live ok while cycling.

You can start your own business and slowly develop it until it can replace your current income. \n\nYou need to have all your processes automated so that your business generates passive income, even when you are sleeping or riding your bike. \n\nIt won't necessarily be easy, let's be clear about that. I'm not offering you a magic solution that will make you financially-free overnight. But I can offer you a business model that works like that. That's what I've been doing for a little over a year and I can work from anywhere, knowing that my business is working for me, even when I'm not in front of my computer. But yes, it takes work. But at least you're working for yourself and not a slave to the system as you say.\n\nIf you think this is something you might be interested in, you can tag me in the comments. I'll be happy to give you access to a free training that explains in detail how it works. For me, it was really eye-opening. \n\nEither way, I wish you the courage to follow your dreams. There are ways to get there and you can be the hero of your own movie. With hard work and determination, anything is possible!\n\nHave a great trip!</span></div>","author":"Patrice Audet","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_559825","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Patrice Audet\"> hi can you give access to the free training  thank you ðŸ˜Š</span></div>","author":"Habibe Chaoui Boudghene","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_66212","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Habibe Chaoui Boudghene\"> sure!

He walked from Idaho to San Diego where he met me and from San Diego we headed North. When we began, our ultimate destination was Talkeetna Alaska but now we'd like to start a home base in Montana. However we are in no hurry as we have been working professionals most of our lives and ultimately decided that we didn't want to get to the end of our lives and only have mediocre jobs that paid measly shillings and caused a lot of stress as the only thing that we did with our lives. I made the decision to take a leap of faith and just know that somehow we would be provided for and we would figure it out along the way which we have. In order to support a very simple but fulfilling lifestyle. What I usually do is I post in each community's Facebook page that we are backpacker/bikepacker's  traveling the coast of California and living off grid in an attempt to discover all that we can about living free and unbound whilst discovering some of the most beautiful coastline in the world. I would post that we could do odd jobs like house cleaning,  landscaping, building projects, pet sitting, catering help,even shopping.Or if any local businesses need any assistance for a meal or anything else that we may need. The response has been overwhelming. We have not needed or wanted for anything. Instinctively people genuinely want to help. And then by helping you out you are in return giving them a gift of being able to help. Also we go through all the local churches and food donation Banks. Bike co-ops are usually where we do our tune-ups or trade in our bikes.
