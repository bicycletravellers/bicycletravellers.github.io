My recommendation is to always use a petrol (gasoline) stove on tours longer than a couple of days, because the fuel is so universally available and cheap.\n\nAnd when I say petrol (gasoline) I mean the stuff you buy from a petrol station (gas station) to put in a car. The stove should run on that, not only naptha or \"white gas\".\n\nNote: when carrying liquid fuels on a tour, especially petrol (gasoline), carry it outside your panniers.
