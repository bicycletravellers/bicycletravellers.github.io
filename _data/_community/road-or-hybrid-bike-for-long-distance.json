Then you have the weight of the suspension, as well as no room for a frame bag or second bottle holder.   As well as everytime it's time to climb a mountain it'll be time to lock the rear suspension unless you like bouncing up and down while pedaling.  I've had a lot of bikes, still have one with dual suspension.   I wouldn't recomend that for touring though, I wouldn't even recomend front.  It makes it harder to find racks and support as much.  It can be done but better without.

That's being a dick.  Reasons it's shit advice. 1 Need to lock out the suspension to avoid wasting all your energy on hills.   2. Adds weight to the total and its completely unnecessary as it's usually locked out.  3. As you mentioned panniers.  Hard to haul anything if you can only use those 20 pound racks that hang off the seatpost, and what else is there unless you lock the rear suspension for the entire trip?  4.  Suspension is one more thing to service that will eventually have problems.  But if you're riding ebikes that doesn't compare to most.  I'm only 40 so I've got another 30 years or so until you'll catch me on one of them.  If I want to cover ground quick I'll hop on my Harley and cross north America on 3 days.   Or I'll use my road bike.  Let's face it if you're riding an ebike limited to 32kph after 3 hours of hard riding I'll be about 20kms ahead of you.  I'm amazed how much ground I can cover on this.
