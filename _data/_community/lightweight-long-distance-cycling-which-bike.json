You don't need to put racks on it and you can still use bikepacking bags if you want. If you did want to put racks on it, and touring bags, you have that option in the future. \nThe gravel bikes are great but can have limited gearing if you are going to climb very steep hills. If you ever wanted to put racks on it, you would be limited to a rear rack.\nRoad bikes are usually designed for head down, bum up riding; which may not be what you are looking for. The tires are often skinny and can limit you to well surfaced roads.\nMy 2c.</div>","author":"Mark Perry","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_883282","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Mountain bike with a trailer</div>","author":"Tim Attwood","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_803503","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Ribble CGR (although they not do the gravel with forks that have mounting points).
