Not all carbon is created equal. Not all titanium is created equal. Not all aluminum is created equal.\n\nCheap budget high volume steel frames are miles away from the quality from a builder that uses custom tubesets (schedule, diameter and butting) profiles. Even in manufactured frames, a Surly LHT or Kona Rove is miles from the ride qualility of the light spirited feel of a Fairlight Secan.\n\nA China made titanium with straight-gauge tubing or generic tube schedule across all sizes is going to be miles away in ride feel from even a Mason Bokah aluminum frame...\n\nMaterial is not the end-all to be-all definitive answer. There is an incredible amount of nuance involved, and there's companies that know what they're doing and make a good product, and those that are just wanting a market share.\n\nThat isn't to say a Surly, Kona or Chinese made titanium are bad bikes at all...\n\nPersonally, my recommendation would be aluminum. It's durable, light, doesn't corrode like steel and inexpensive. With modern alloying, butting, and hydroforming techniques, a quality aluminum frame is really hard to beat in terms of performance....unless its ultimate performance that you're after.\n\nReally it depends on your goals.\nFast minimalist bikepacking, weight is a key factor along with comfort...carbon\nLongest term durability, in my opinion steel but also aluminum. Titanium is very good, has a lot of great qualities but stupid expensive to get a frame that's worth the material. I just believe for bikepacking where you're strapping a bunch of gear to the frame, subjecting it to conditions outside the normal usecase (unless its a dedicated touring bike), aluminum is just the easiest material to deal with, and modern aluminum frames don't fail that often and often as cheap as a repair to replace and the old frame recycled.\n\nIf you look at Koga bikes ....there is a reason their flagship touring bike is aluminum, and a lot of R&amp;D and thought went into the frame before the material was decided upon, it just so happened that aluminum was the most balanced material for the application, and it is considered one of the very best on/off road touring bikes on the market.</div>","author":"Josh Kebschull","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_539918","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Josh Kebschull\"> #steelisreal</span></div>","author":"Gyula Jung","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_111808","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Josh Kebschull\"> that's why people have to put in the effort and do their own research.

There is just far too many variables to consider and factor in. A perfect example is that you can a high-end steel production frame like the Ritchey Road Logic or Fairlight Strael and stack it against C'Dale CAAD10 (or  the present 13 if you want disc brakes) or the Specialized Allez Sprint...back to back most would actually prefer the aluminum bikes.\n\nThere are some great steel HT MTBs, but the moment you add long travel or suspension, still just goes out the window....there are some that do it, but there really isn't a production steel full suspension bike on the market that competes with the Ibis Ripley or Ripmo AF and there are just far too many examples of superior aluminum MTBs. It's just a better application, and done correclty, a better product.\n\nThere are places where steel excels, but I argue that in the past years of vast improvement in manufacturing...the gap has been closed or passed altogether.</span></div>","author":"Josh Kebschull","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_647083","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Josh Kebschull\"> you could be right but the main problem is identifying the good ones.
