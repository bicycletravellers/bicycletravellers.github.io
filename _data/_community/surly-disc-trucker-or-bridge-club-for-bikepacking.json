My understanding is that the trucker is for hauling your entire belongings across the world. I used to ride the Salsa Marrakesh, which is a similar bike. I found it to be more than I needed almost all of the time, but it was great for carrying loads. The bridge club is more of an all-arounder for the rest of us. I've heard great things about all Surly bikes, and I love mine. If it were for me, and I was mainly going to go camping, I'd lean toward the bridge club.</div>","author":"Lance Lennick","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_223819","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">We are working up to a cross country run in 2023 or 2024.

Surly makes quality bicycles. My preference, I would go with the disc trucker because of the geometry and more hand positions on those handlebars. Looks like the disc specifies a stronger wheel(36H spoke) and hub (12x100), but the bridge has higher gearing with a 51t cog vs DT’s 48t large cog. Same size tire width and diameter except tread on the bridge club. Drivetrain looks slightly better on bridge club but I think disc trucker is more versatile and true to what you picture when you think touring. Long haul trucker was a fantastic model. In the end it’s your choice and preference. People tour on all sorts of bicycles, whether it’s a hybrid, hardtail, road, touring, etc and all seem to enjoy the ride.</div>","author":"Alex Olivares","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_977481","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">My first small tour was on a modified giant cypress st hybrid bicycle with 700x28c tires.</div>","author":"Alex Olivares","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_627914","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">The Trucker rides better loaded than unloaded, which is a great thing if that’s it’s sole purpose.
