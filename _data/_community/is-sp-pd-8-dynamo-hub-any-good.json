I got turned on to dynamos on a tour through Germany about 7 years ago.  I bought an entire system on the spot and sent my other wheel home.\n\nSince then I've had 3 of various.  They worked fine and still do.  They used to keep my GPS charged and still can keep a cell phone charged.\n\nBut the electronics requirements of at least GPS devices has gotten more demanding and dynamos mostly can't charge them.  It's now older technology.\n\nSo last year I got a Pedal cell to try.  And it's marvelous.  There are many advantages.  The biggest aside from it actually generating copious amounts of electricity is that it's easily disassembled and moved.  Or disengage it for long uphills to eliminate resistance.  Though it surprisingly works some even then.  In any case you're not stuck with one wheel.  I swap mine now and then.  And it doesn't require a separate invertor.  I've used a B&amp;L and c2c.  Both were fine.  But the invertor is included in the Pedal cell.  If you want a Dynamo I'll sell you one cheap.  Same goes for an invertor.
