Crossing Israel/Egypt should be possible, if not there is for 100% a boat from Aqaba to Nuweiba. Iran, Turkey easy. Syria is actually possible but only with a guide so it means lots of money. Libanon probably partly possible but its a dead end. Iraq... Kurdistan Iraq is possible but rest of the Iraq is more difficult but probably possible. I've read few posts from the people traveling Kuwait/Iraq and Jordan/Iraq by car/motorcycle. But nobody by bicycle so far. (Please, give me a favour and do that. Thanx) Afghanistan...?

But be prepared to have police follow you the whole way, checkpoint to checkpoint outside the cities to protect you from kidnappings. One bad situation with ISIS kidnapping and killing a foreigner resulted in Egyptian authorities doing everything they can to protect tourists and stay out of the news in the negative light of terrorism. Some of the checkpoints have areas to setup your tent and you'll be drinking a lot of tea or coffee with them. It can get annoying but turn it into a fun experience and accept it :)\n\nIsrael doesn't stamp your passport. They give you a separate paper with the stamp so you can trash it after you leave but Jordan and Egypt don't. What does this mean? If you go to Qatar, Iran, Iraq, lybia, kuwait, Syria, Lebanon, and Pakistan after using these land borders from Israel into neighboring countries (Jordan and Egypt) they will not permit you entry because to them, you could be a spy. \n\nMake sure you plan your route accordingly. Qatar and Iran immigration officers look for the Jordan and Egyptian stamps diligently. I can't say how close the other countries look but they all belong to the Arab/Muslim group to blacklist not just Israelis, but anyone who visited Israel for fear of letting spies into the country because unlike Hollywood, this is how real spies get in - legally! Fake passports are impossible to make these days since 9/11. Technology improved a lot.\n\nIf you are American, you can get a 2nd identical active passport printed specifically for this. Just make sure you use it properly which might mean having to fly into a country to avoid land border stamps in Jordan or Egypt adjacent to Israel‚Ä¶. \n\nSome of these countries in the middle east trace your trip if you entered by land so if all of a sudden they see you entered Saudi Arabia from Jordan by land but don't see how you entered Jordan (land, sea, or air, they will assume you are trying to hide your way because you obviously came through Israel so you must be a spy for the Zionists. To reiterate, if Iran or Qatar don't see a stamp into Jordan or Egypt from air land, or sea port they will assume you're a spy. You will be interrogated for hours to days or detained for even a long time. It's serious and not a joke. Not worth the time or fear you'll face until they reach their own conclusions that you aren't a spy and let you continue your travels. And probably have their secret police follow you to make sure but you won't even know\n\nYou can ask the land border officers in Jordan or Egypt to stamp your Israeli paper stamp instead of your passport. Make sure to tell them BEFORE you give them your passport. They are understanding and accommoding but again, this will help with some of the other countries in the ME or Pakistan/Afghanistan, but not Iran or Qatar for sure and possibly also in Iraq or Lybia.\n\nThis is why not many ride their bikes from Africa through the middle East without a fly over..\n\nIsrael has done a few covert ops in said countries in recent decades to bring terrorists to justice or disrupt nuclear power operations to preemptively defend themselves. They won't wait until after its too late. They learned to take the crazies seriously when they say they want to kill us all. Since WWII, never again regardless left or right wing govt, security in Israel is the least politicized. They will do what needs to be done to prevent another hitler. And that might make bike tourers routes a bit more challenging without flying over a the only democratically free country in the ME.  \n\nSorry. Govts suck. But the people are awesome. Hope it goes well for you.\n\nP.S. - If you fly over Israel from Egypt into Jordan or the other way for example, you'll get bonus points iN Iran or Qatar. They will see the stamps and dates of the airports and will assume you also \"hate\" the Zionists. Play along, get out of the port, and enjoy the people in any of those countries. They are the complete opposite of their oppressive, fearful, paranoid govts. Especially the Iranian people as I'm sure you know.</div>","author":"Adir Sharon","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_138781","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Adir Sharon\"> i am coming from north of France and would love to go to middle east without crossing Europe, reason why i was thinking to go through north eastern Africa first... i don t know yet wich way i could go, maybe i have to avoid Lybia, and go through Niger then Egypt and start with France then boat to Algeria or Tunisia...ü§î</span></div>","author":"Samy Jousse","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_656277","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Samy Jousse\"> if you thought you could ride from Morocco to Egypt through north Africa, unfortunately you can't.

Countries know people have multiple passports. Some like Iran, Russia, China, Afghanistan, etc who are extra paranoid about spies might dig deeper so I would recommend you use one passport for your tour and the other passport for future travel to those countries. It's not unheard of those countries to detain people with multiple passports until they can prove to themselves you aren't a spy. I have 3 passports, 2 citizenships. I only travel with 2 of them because of this.

You will learn with your experience or research. Call your embassy for advice on your route. ask if you get kidnapped if they will come to your rescue. They might say yes for x country but not for y.. than make your mind. \n\nOne friend and another tourer I met on the road weren't so fortunate as others who assume the risk. They didn't think it could happen to them. One disappeared and never heard from again presumed dead in Syria. The other, a friend since college, was released after 6 month in prison. They said he smuggled drugs (he was a straight edge Christian - didn't even drink or smoke cigarettes). Either someone used him as an unaware mule or a corrupt immigration officer set him up to get a bonus.
