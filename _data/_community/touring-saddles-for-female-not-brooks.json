As an endurance/ultra rider I can tell you that this is very personal and what works for one person may or may not work for some one else., you only really fin out after 5 hour riding and never in the shop.   The general rule is sit bones + 2 cm, but that does not count for how the nose fits between your thighs when peddling and the pressure points in that region.  I have a female friend that has some very specific challenges thanks to a pelvis broken in a car crash. We are very excited about the developments in sadles from Ergon, and the work Endura has been doing with a famous bike filter on the padding in women cycling shorts.  Endura  offer their shorts (and longs) with different pad sizes depending on your saddle size !  Finally we are getting a parts of that compliment each other. ( Please note.
