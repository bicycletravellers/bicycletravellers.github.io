The pole goes in my (half) frame bag.\n\nIf you're talking leaving your campsite setup and then going to the pub/cafe, sightseeing, exploring.....I guess it depends where you are.....For me, that's not common practice.

They're likely going to be cautious to see if anyone is around first, but likely leave with the bike....\n\nThe essence of wild camping is obviously for nobody to know you're there. If your possesions are hidden well enough 99 times out of 100 it will be there when you return, but all it takes is that one time where someone has a thief mentality and your stuff is gone....then what's the strategy?\n\nIt's not so different than parking your commuter bike outside a building locked to a post only to come out and see the wheels and seatpost/saddle are missing. Stuff can happen when you leave opportunities for people to take advantage of the situatioin.\n\nIf I go to a pub/cafe by bike....I sit on the patio/garden close to my bike/gear...which I do often because here in Belgium with the summer we've been having, but the bike doesn't exactly leave my sight. If trhey don't have a patio/garden, I find a different place to eat/drink.</span></div>","author":"Josh Kebschull","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_297225","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Ok cool</div>","author":"Kev Trueman","gender":"FEMALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_19687","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">My first tour to the seaside is more about saving money getting there by not having to fill up with petrol.
