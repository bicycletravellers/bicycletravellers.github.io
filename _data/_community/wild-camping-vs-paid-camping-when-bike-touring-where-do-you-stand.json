Many countries have limited camping which may only be available for a couple of months a year, even if it is inexpensive. I think wild camping just becomes the norm for some cyclists, a habit, one which greatly simplifies things on a daily basis. If you're willing to veer off the main roads on to quieter and quieter side roads, you're likely to find a place where you won't be bothered or even seen. I've camped in places where no car came by the entire time I was there. If you're obliged to go through areas which seem to be 100% agricultural and heavily fenced, you can always ask a farmer if you can pitch a tent on their land. I start thinking about spots at least an hour before sunset so I can find a decent, comfortable place to pitch my tent - in the hills, near water, in a forest or park - somewhere flat that's not too hard to get in and out of and where I can relax without worrying about getting \"caught\" and feeling like a criminal, which has only happened once. It was on a vineyard in Italy and when the farmer saw my bike he told me to stay as long as I liked.

Each site needs to be considered on its own merits.  Something rarely mentioned in articles about wild camping; the 'elephant in the room' is toileting!  I carry a small trowel, dig a hole the night before in case it's a rush job in the morning.  In grassland, the turf can be replaced and you'd hardly know!  I little trick if there are likely to be people around, is to take down your inner tent, giving you a covered space in the outer tent to 'do the business'. Replace the turf, pack up your tent and no one's any the wiser.\n\nA small green tent is best for wild camping, the more out of sight the better.  If you do happen to be discovered and asked to move - be courteous and move.  The very few times when the landowner or his agent has confronted me, they've always been happy knowing I'll be gone in the morning.  Often, if the landowner/tenant farmer's house is obvious, then I've asked, rarely being refused.  \n\nHowever, now 70 years old (where the hell did that go!), I'm into mini-adventures now.
