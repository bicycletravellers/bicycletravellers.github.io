Touring you would most likely exceed that. If you are going off road, then jolting will greatly increase the load on the seams and mounting points. Looking at the construction, it does not appear to be super strong, and that method of seam construction may see seams open up. The velcro straps that attach the panniers to the bike may not hold them down if you bounce, and the panniers could fly off the rack. By comparison the Decathlon Elops500 waterproof pannier has a much more secure mounting mechanism.\n\nThe risk using these bags looks like they would be ripping the mounting hooks out oft the back of the bags and burst seams.\n\n I have used bags like this for commuting and shopping, which they do well, but maybe not up to the rigours of touring. Yes, you could tour with them, but Decathlon's exceptional warantee service suggests that they know the limits of their products, and if they don't suggest you use them for touring, then they might just have a point.</div>","author":"Mark Perry","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_353336","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mark Perry\">  exellent explanation</span></div>","author":"Harald Hartman","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_45837","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I expect you could try to make the mounting scheme stronger...</div>","author":"Robert Clark","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_903623","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Try to check this <a href=\"https://www.tailfin.cc/discipline/road/?v=ea8a1a99f6c9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.tailfin.cc/discipline/road/?v=ea8a1a99f6c9</a></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tailfin.cc%2Fdiscipline%2Froad%2F%3Fv%3Dea8a1a99f6c9&amp;h=AT3TcPSidBtnVEqMQQ02MeC15VysbGB6qCbKdK5qwER0C6ln8v5D_jfJLZF95zhQVG3Lzxbfa4u-Y44XIZa68vKgJ1i6zBs2bqPKARABb6JMarhscbUkM4SSFRW8UBDk5XoN4fzZfuUp4TS3Xl1HfxdJTUiozfER19o&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.tailfin.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CarbonX.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Road/Touring - Tailfin Cycling</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">tailfin.cc</span></a></div></div>","author":"Benny V.

You could ask the staff if you can carry them over to a decathlon bike in the store, and see for yourself how well they hold when you shake them.\n\nLet's also look at real risk: On the front wheel, the danger of something breaking is much more severe than on the back, because if s.th. blocks your front wheel, you will fly over the handlebar. On the back wheel, it can be dangerous when you are driving directly next to heavy traffic, but usually much less dangerous than when something happens near the front wheel. So this is risk to you, bike, car drivers. Another risk may be that the bag falls off and s.o. riding right behind you drives over it and falls.\n\nThen let's look at risk for your belongings. In the worst case, you will lose some t-shirts. Perhaps carry a small shopping bag in case something really breaks, so you don't stand there with a hand full of laundry. But to be honest, probably they will hold up for your weekend tour. But if you like it, you would buy something better again.</div>","author":"Matthias Tango","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_2016","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Decathlon make some proper touring panniers which are pretty good</div>","author":"Brendan Payne","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_807017","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Why would you go for them when the manufacturer specifically states that they're not suitable for touring?</div>","author":"Adam Macer","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_440180","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Don't have a balance, and not useful</div>","author":"Turgay Keleş","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_553622","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">try <span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Crosso\"></span></div>","author":"Robert Mac","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_513453","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">From what I can see, everything looks like it's made with cloth and are only kept in place with gravity.
