But the real consideration is that the parts be durable and repairable for crossing Africa (I may even turn it into a world trip).\n\nWhat advice do you have for parts given the above? I'm thinking of wider tyres without suspension, but not sure how wide to go. Jones bar? What drivetrain? I've heard of Rohloff-like systems, but am concerned about repairs in remote areas.

With the discs and mechanical pads, the hydraulic ones are too difficult to fix if damaged.

On a trip from Vancouver to Mexico, you will find plenty of options of \"off roads\" for instance. In the Americas, the most impressive landscapes are on the west side. In Africa, don't miss Ethiopia and Namibia. But Cameroun and Egypt, depending on which side of Africa you choose,  are worth the visit.\nDon't prepare too much.

An awesome bike that took an absolute beating on some of the worst roads you could imagine. The frame did snap in Argentina but got it brazed. It lasted until Canada and had it welded but only lasted a week. I then welded it myself and put a clamp on it and is still going. I had standard rim brakes but would recommend discs. I ran a Rohloff hub gear and although had a couple of issues the backup service from Rohloff was second to none and looking at the terrain and weight I carried it was perfect for the job. The one thing I would do is change the ridged forks for suspension forks.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/a-question-on-the-quality-of-a-surly-bikes-is-it-worth-it/image_1655133907.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>",

You mention suspension. Most people say not to get it as it's an extra part that can be hard to repair in remote regions. An option I've been considering is a shock-absorbing stem that can easily be replaced with a regular stem.</span></div>",
