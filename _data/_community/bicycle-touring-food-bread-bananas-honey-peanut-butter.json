It depends on the water source as well, some water will already have plenty. At home I tend to add baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and epsom salts (magnesium sulphate) but it can be just a pinch of regular table salt. It depends as well on the temperature, the level of effort, your own body, whether you get cramps, I have done plenty of riding just on plain water. But adding salt can be a good idea, it can improve hydration. You can also get electrolyte tabs or use mixes that include both electrolytes and carbs, I used use these racing. Another good cheap option in many countries is Oral Rehydration Salts, these are very inexpensive in many developing countries and are designed for optimum rehydration.

Mostly carbs which is good as that is your primary energy source. Your body can only process about 30-60 grams of carb per hour, more than that and it sits in your stomach and could cause GI distress. 5 Bananas( each about 25 carbs) and bagels(about 45 carbs each) would be approx. 400 grams, so 80 grams an hour not including any honey. Personally I would make a couple sandwiches ahead and put in baggies, take 2-3 bananas. You may want to include a drink with electrolytes especially if you sweat much. You are not trying to replace the full mount of calories lost. Eat a high carb breakfast prior to ride and refuel within one hour after ride with carb and protein for best recovery.</div>","author":"Barbara Hart","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_139693","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Looks like you'll spend more time eating than riding...</div>","author":"Dave Henderson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_845427","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Dave Henderson\"> that doesn't seem enough for me</span></div>","author":"Gerald Arreto","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_25561","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Gerald Arreto\"> - For 50km?
