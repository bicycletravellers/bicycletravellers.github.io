At the time I'd only gone about 6 miles on them and couldn't make an honest assessment. However, after about 75 miles on them I can tell what I think to date.\n\nThe brakes are the Growtac Equal in the Very Berry red. I purchased them on the Velo ORANGE site (I will include the link below). The ones I bought are the post mount mechanical brakes, and retail for $390 (US). \n\nNo, they are not cheap. Yes, they work incredibly well. The brakes come with everything you need. I have mine set up using the compressionless cables. I am not a small roadie type. I'm 6-05 and weigh about 350 lbs. That means it takes a lot of work to stop this mass of ass when bombing down hill, and these brakes do just that. I have yet to need to fully lock them down because they do such a good job of slowing me at speed. \n\nI've used other mechanical brakes systems such as the Avid BB7's, which I like and have on another bike I own. In fact, I was going to put the BB7's on my Velo Orange, but I decided to go big and use the Growtac's instead. \n\nGoing big meant dropping some hefty cash too. I paid more for these than for my Shimano XT hydraulic brakes. That being said, the Growtac's also actually do a better job of stopping me than my XT's. They have great modulation, and I can feather them easily while on a big descent. \n\nUltimately, you just need to ask yourself what it is you want, and what fits your needs. I wanted a solid mechanical brake setup to run with dropbars, and these fit the bill. #growtac #veloorange \n\n<a href=\"https://velo-orange.com/collections/brakes/products/growtac-equal-brakes-post-mount?variant=41254387679407\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://velo-orange.com/collections/brakes/products/growtac-equal-brakes-post-mount?variant=41254387679407</a><div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_album_attachment\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/a-review-of-the-growtac-post-mount-equal-disc-brakes/image_1659022771_280692850.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/a-review-of-the-growtac-post-mount-equal-disc-brakes/image_1659022771_2902489074.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/a-review-of-the-growtac-post-mount-equal-disc-brakes/image_1659022771_9653025540.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/a-review-of-the-growtac-post-mount-equal-disc-brakes/image_1659022771_2401594520.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_430868","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_591059","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">It‚Äôs all about having the correct housing and getting your particular levers cable pull synced with the caliper.</div>","author":"Mark Studnicki","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_279129","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mark Studnicki\"> the bike mechanic who installed them did say they were kind of a pain to set up.
