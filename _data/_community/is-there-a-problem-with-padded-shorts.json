The saddle's shell should be pretty flexible, if it's not then it is highly unlikely to offer any kind of comfort. Most decent saddle with have a flexible shell combined with various levels of padding. The goal is to find a saddle that distributes the pressure and flexes with your body. \n\nSaddles with cutouts are generally a good thing as they reduce pressure in sensitive areas. However, you have to be careful because they also reduce body contact and can increase pressure in other places. If these other areas don't get along well this can cause problems. \n\nPersonally, I've been trying to go chamois-less for a number of seasons, and am finally giving into the fact that no chamois isn't something my body can handle at this time. \n\nI've also found that the most comfortable saddle for me has been a relatively minimal saddle with medium thickness and density padding. I compared this to a very similar saddle with thicker padding and I found that I sat into the padding too much and wasn't as comfortable past the 30-45 minute mark. \n\nA friend once told me that you don't want the most comfortable saddle... You want the saddle with the highest level of static comfort. I find this to be true. Saddles that are super comfy for 20-40 minutes tend to get more uncomfortable the longer you are on them. Lesser padded saddles may not provide that high level of initial comfort, but seem not to get as uncomfortable as quickly. \n\nA good pair of bike shorts also makes a big difference. A chamois is a great way to add padding that moves with your body and comfort to a lightly padded saddle. \n\nGood luck... I went through 8-9 saddles before settling on the one I'm currently using. I found that getting the height and tilt right make a big difference and that it's worth spending some extra time experimenting and dialing these in.</div>","author":"Greg Maino","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_921468","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">No more for me since using a very soft Italian leather Infinity saddle, makes life more enjoyable.

Prior to purchasing, I had my sit bones measured and found that I had been riding a size smaller that I needed for 1000’s of miles.  I scheduled a bike fit at the same time which surfaced issues with my cleats, bar orientation and stem length. With that saddle, I rode 210 miles on gravel last Thursday/Friday and had no numbness or pain that wasn’t chafing caused by not reapplying Chamois Butt’r on a 90 degree 80% humidity day when I should have.  I was out the next day with no soreness at all. \nSome of it is just getting your body acquainted.  The other part is finding the saddle that fits you.  I love my Expert but you may find that a Brooks or Selle fits you better, based on your body shape and riding style. Ask your local shop about their return policy and see if they will set you up on a trainer with several types of saddles.  At $150-$200 for one made with materials that will last, you 100% have the right to be picky and try things out.  I would say, at minimum, a center cut-out is a must as it eliminates numbness.

Personally i prefer bibs with a chamois. But not all \"padding\" (chamois) are equal. I bought a $75 pair of Pearl Izumi with blue flat padding and they were awful. You should to find something with a 3D design to the padding. And the fit of the shorts is as important as the fit of the saddle. Too loose causes issues. One model i like are these, made in california and at a reasonable cost. You can also wear MTB shorts over them as well. <a href=\"https://store.voler.com/collections/mens-bib-shorts-and-shorts/products/1110806\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://store.voler.com/collections/mens-bib-shorts-and-shorts/products/1110806</a>\n\nI would not recommend a Brooks Cambium saddle for someone new to this. They're great saddles (I have two) but the rubber top is a very different approach than most saddles. If you're a member of REI you can buy a saddle and return it if it doesn't work for you. A good bike shop would work with you as well and some have loaners to try. Some good models have been mentioned but this is a highly personal issue so try several. If you wanted to go with no padding historically a new leather Brooks B17 is the way to go, but I've found models from Fabric are quite comfortable with padded cycling shorts. REI carries the Fabric Radius Scoop. And of course a bike fit is immensely helpful for many issues including saddles.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.voler.com%2Fcollections%2Fmens-bib-shorts-and-shorts%2Fproducts%2F1110806&amp;h=AT1tsYvPY6gv7SYKIG3Lvy2JK2fJ8Jf3RcNv8Kv4YdPDtKMyUxMg_74TzuYV2SvDUx0VteH9k2pT9JELiy_6WSGZ_cVnFFVcuQezUK6OSFcYQOyZJEq95F_hY9nNMgvkghydKnIJ3vA1xsg&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0527/0316/6654/products/2021-M-Stow-Bib-Solid-Black-F.jpg?v=1623441908\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">M'S STOW BIB LINER</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">store.voler.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Eric Zamora","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_781526","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">You are missing a ton!

Depending on your seatpost clamp mechanism this saddle may or may not properly mount to your seatpost. \n\nHere is an account of my experience. First impression... Yeah, it looks bad ass for sure! And it better be all that and more at $450. I inboxed it and it’s definitely light at 193g. Most high line saddles are in the mid 200g range with the lightest saddles weighing in at about half the weight, but that’s a straight carbon saddle with little or no padding.\n\nWhen I push in the padding in the sit bone area with my thumb to gauge the cushion it pushes in deeply with little resistance, and it’s firmer in the surrounding areas. I thought it was going to ride like a marshmallow... NOT. When I first sit on it, contrary to what I would expect, it feels quite firm, hard in fact, and for me personally it feels quite “flat”. I think that’s because rather than higher pressure points under my sit bones with lower pressure on the surrounding areas, my sit bones sink into the seat instantly and spread out the pressure more equally to the surrounding areas.\n\nOnce I started riding the flat sensation quickly disappeared. It feels very firm, but without pressure points. The further I am into a ride the less I think about the seat. It just disappears from my consciousness. The opposite of all previous saddles where the longer I was into the ride, the more I’m thinking about the seat and the discomfort. Previously after 35, 50, 70+ miles my sit bone area would become tender and something I had to “get through” until I completed my ride. So far My longest ride has been about 65 miles with NO discomfort what so ever. \n\nSo back to the price. Yes, it’s a lot of money for a saddle, too much in fact, but what’s it worth to you to get rid of long ride discomfort? They retail for $450, but you can get one for $385 if you buy directly from Specialized as a “1st order” after opening an account with them. The most I’ve ever paid for a saddle. That said I have more than that amount of money in saddles that are sitting on the shelf in my garage that I’m not using 😉\n\nFortunity I only do long rides on my gravel bike so the rest of my bikes can stick with the other saddles.\n\nUPDATE - I now havev4 of these saddles, one for every bike\n\nI rate it 🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍</span></div>","author":"Mark Jake Jacobson","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_495189","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mark Jake Jacobson\"> Unless you plan to ride your bike with someone else's ass, other people's saddle suggestions are worth less than shit.
