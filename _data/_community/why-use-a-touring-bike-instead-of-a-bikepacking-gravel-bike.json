Many new gravel bikes have all the necessary braze-ons to add the necessary racks etc. for touring. Any touring bike with wheels and tires from 700 x32 or larger are good in gravel. For that matter any old mountain bike with two or three front rings can be used as a gravel bike or to tour as well if set up with dual purpose tires rather than just knobby tires. \n\nI was in a bike accident where I had a shoulder injury. For a while, during recovery, I made my old 1999 Rocky Mountain Hammer Race into a hybrid by raising the handle bars and adding Michelin Protek Urban tires 26 x 1.85.
