With the screen off and not connected to a power source, using any other navigation software, it doesn't fare too well.\nTech rant:  I figure that the android library code for agps drops the 'assisted' part when I use navigation software with the screen off as a power saving feature. This is something I have no options available in my settings for changing... The conspiracy theorist inside of me thinks that google inc. (alphabet) is aware of this issue but is unlikely to fix it as it suits them fine. \n\nI don't particularly care for Alphabet inc., a massive advertising company, knowing my location 24hrs a day without my consent - a capability that is on the level of GCHQ or other spook's access to information.
