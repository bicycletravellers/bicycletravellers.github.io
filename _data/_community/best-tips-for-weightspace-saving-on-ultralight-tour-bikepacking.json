I just bought a one-man tent.  Poles were standard 3 pieces and optionally 5 pieces.  Both shock-corded.  The reason it matters is pole storage for bike touring/packing is always a hassle for standard-length poles.    I do think Big Angus offers the smaller pole option and I hope it catches on.  The 1-man tent I just bought was a 6-moon design and I am happy I paid an upcharge for the 5-section pole versus the standard 3.

We all overpack.  Lay it all out and remove at least 10%.  You don‚Äôt need as many clothes as you think.  Convertible pants can count as a pair of shorts too.  Find other twofers.  Sun sleeves can eliminate need for long sleeve shirt. 2 kits are plenty.  My mentor goes with 1 kit, but I draw the line‚Ä¶. Riding shoes and lightweight Crocs or equivalent.  My preference - one spare tube and patch kit, a  hand pump and no cartridges.  I don‚Äôt carry a cook kit.  Also - try to reduce as you are - but this isn‚Äôt backpacking - a few extra pounds on a bike doesn‚Äôt matter - especially if it‚Äôs a comfort item.  For example - I don‚Äôt take anything that requires a belt - but, if your fav shorts requires a belt - take it.  Tarp only tent works - but depends on where traveling and time of year.  Also - sleeping bag might be optional - just go with a liner and use a puffy jacket if it drops in temp.  Also - get a half size air mattress - shoulder to butt is adequate vs full size (either air or pad mattress).</div>","author":"Peter Diotte","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_245545","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">One other recommendation.
