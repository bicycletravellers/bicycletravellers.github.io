Basically a great brake lever with any permutation of rear index/friction and up to 3 x in front.  \n\nI am a huge fan of also of Silver shifters from Soma- a bit hard to get (maybe Rivendell) \n\nTouring is hard on shifters.  Friction is great.  It will get you home and allow you to correct for all sorts of ills- bent cages, bent hangers, kinked cables.  \n\nBtw the Gevenalle shifts have a unique feature of going easy to hard front and back in the same direction.   You are basically mounting a downtube shifter on a brake lever. Index to friction requires a 4 mm lever and a click of a ring. Takes about 10 seconds.

Cable should. Have no pressure on them just snug. If you have considerably pressure on the smallest may because your cables are getting old and have stretched . Then at tune ups barrel adjustment has tightened to get it to shift as smith as can be when go up to your climbing gear in rear. You may have it chatting also. Cables get old and also stretchy over the years. Always change cable sleeves when you do this unless on the road. I carry an extra cable with me in long trips.  If you are in a very hilly area and the back cable breaks . You could have almost an impossible gear range to use. Your rear cassette will go to the smallest 11 or 12 . You can go to the end of the sleeve and use a small vice grip to put chain in a middle gear. Or push over by hand the derailer and adjust the stop. You will now have a manageable 3 speed  with trips. And 2 speed  if compact. It the front cable goes you can still ride it will go to granny.</span></div>","author":"Bob Kirby","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_965146","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/wRDD0E6YQjc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/wRDD0E6YQjc</a></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FwRDD0E6YQjc&amp;h=AT3fbQPsFgdEIgPTRIEgLVmMyzDMQea_yK1_0BGlx3mT5MA_uAw8mO-KBprN_b4BjLOSba2pAASa99JD3ycE23MqOt_p-Hm_NgB7TDj--Yb586WFPVChHgSiKySwW0_ANrhzRXiIMUswswk&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wRDD0E6YQjc/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Why EVERYONE Should Try Friction Shifters!</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">youtube.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Russ Roca","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_770137","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I used to have them for years.
