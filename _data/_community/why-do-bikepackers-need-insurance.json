Required a Gamma nail, reconstruction of the bone and a plate. Spent the first 8 months on crutches, had to go back in for more surgery at two and a half years for a different plate as no bone growth whatsoever. Spent another 3 months on crutches and finally we stated to get some union.\nI didn't have health insurance,  but thankfully l live in Australia and we have government health care and so the health system covered the surgeries and related medical costs. However because there was no car involved, or any other paty, ll wasn't eligible for third party insurance and therefore no wage support , income or psychological support, or support on getting to and from the hospital l had to attend every six weeks for almost 3 years.\nI spent all my savings, my long service leave and any extra I'd paid off my house in an effort to pay business loans, credit card debt and not lose my house.\nHowever l had been begrudgingly digging super deep into my pocket for an insane amount ( working at height doesn't help ) for income protection  and that saved me from financial ruin and becoming a hobo</div>","author":"Sandy Maxwell","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_893161","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Sandy Maxwell\"> I know you.
