It isn't very common for carbon manufacturers to provide detailed specs of material grade and layup thicknesses/techniques.\n\nCarbon is marketed as \"super light weight\" which is its own self fulfilling prophecy: manufacturers build carbon rigs with weight a key marketing concern. This means a lot of - but not all - carbon frames come underbuilt for bikepacking.\n\nMaterial ride quality and vibration dampening characteristics are dependent on a bunch of design nuances, but in very broad strokes, carbon tends to ride more comfortable than aluminum but a bit harsher than steel and ti. Carbon is relatively temperature neutral making it a great bikepacking frame material for very cold winter bikepacking.\n\nCarbons biggest bikepacking advantage over other materials for remote travel is that it is BY FAR the most easily repairable of the frame materials. With relatively low expertise, you could carry sheets of carbon and epoxy and fix a cracked frame in the middle of nowhere. It probably wouldn't look pretty, but it'd get the job done and carbon repair kits are light weight, not super bulky, and inexpensive.\n\nI personally use steel and ti for my bikepacking rigs but wouldn't count out carbon as a suitable material for bikepacking frames... Just use a discerning eye and realize carbon frames tend to be underbuilt for bikepacking, not because carbon isn't strong, but because the manufacturers have decided to make the bike extra light at the expense of some durability.</div>","author":"Cameron Sanders","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_36762","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">most materials can be engineered for a ride quality and purpose.

Perhaps when you mention bikepacking you mean primarily riding on off-road, gravel, dirt or single track routes. In that case, it is probably better to use a frame built with stronger material than carbon fiber. \nIf you’re riding on pavement, a carbon frame bike weighs less which is an advantage.  However if you are a big guy and/or your cargo is very heavy, check the weight limit since carbon frame bikes have a lower weight capacity.  For me it’s no problem….

If it is the only bike you have go for it and enjoy yourself. They aren't meant to be heavy loads over long distances being bashed about.
