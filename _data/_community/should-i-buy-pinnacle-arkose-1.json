I came across the Pinnacle Arkose 1 (Evans cycle) which seems to be a very good option - very versatile and not too expensive. \n\nIf any of you uses it, I'd love to get your feedback! Should I go for that one? I was wondering if the bike had enough gears to take on steep climbs and if it was possible to attach fork bags to it?\n\nIf you've got any recommendations for other gravel bikes I should look into, please share those too! My budget is Â£800-900\n\nThanks</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_777440","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_788751","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">The Arkose 1 is well respected for what it is, bare in mind that your budget (and mine) means you are looking towards the bottom-end of the new bike market.</div>","author":"Chris Van","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_318398","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">The Decathlon Triban RC520 would be my pick new for your budget.
