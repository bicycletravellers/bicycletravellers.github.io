I've been using a no-name Alu tubing one, of a conventional if a little old-school design. It served me well, but it's about 15 years old, and is getting on a bit. Got a new bike, so I'm thinking maybe I should treat it to a new rack. Riding - heavy touring, with full 40ltr panniers, a tent, a top bag, a grab bag, and often water. We're talking 25+ kilos, sometimes 30+ (although I know some people prefer balancing the load along the bike, it works for me, so the question isn't about whether I should or shouldn't move some weight to the front).\nThe bike is a 700c gravel one, flat mount disks, 142mm rear axle, rack mounts. Panniers are Ortlieb Back Roller.\nI have my eye on TorTec Expedition one, or perhaps the Epic. I particularly like the low and further-back extra rails: if there were anything I'd like different about my current rack, it would be lower rails and lower centre of gravity. \nWeight isn't a massive priority; a couple of hundred grams here or there don't matter, as I am only ever using it for big loads. \nSo which one then? And there seem to be alloy or stainless options, stainless being a bit heavier, comparatively a lot pricier, and presumably somewhat stronger. I'd be happy with alloy, based on my past experience. \nOr are there any decent alternatives to TorTec, broadly along the same lines? Low rails, and something to put the panniers' bottom hooks over. \nThanks!\n(this is a different bike on the picture, but that's how I'm loading stuff, just to give you an idea of what I am looking for)<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"post_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/need-a-new-rack-for-heavy-loaded-touring/image_1655566980_2519656522.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_648946","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_317044","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I like the TorTec Expedition too myself, it is rated to 30KG.
