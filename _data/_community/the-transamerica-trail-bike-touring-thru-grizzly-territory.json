Thanks for pointing it out.  Yes.  The whole bear thing is totally over the edge.  In Alaska where I lived most of my life probably more people got killed by moose.  I can tell you I've been chased by moose a few times and never by a bear.  Though I've had more than a few encounters.  All were brown bears.  They want nothing to do with people unless they feel forced into it.  Black bears actually are more bothersome.  But in a nuisance kind of way.  In short as cyclists we've a lot more to worry about from people actions.  Cars and etc.</span></div>","author":"Daniel Ellsworth","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_178206","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Daniel Ellsworth\"> As I quipped the problem with bears is the tourists driving giant RVS so intent on gawking at wildlife they fail to see bicyclists with whom the need to share the road.
