There are also tire boots.\nIn the extrememly unlikely evet that you slice a tire or rupture the tire wall. For ruptures, tire boots sit in the tire over the hole, you then put in your tube and inflate. The tire boot stops the tube from expanding out of the tire wall. You can also use a dollar bill, as it is a non paper material and is waterproof.\nWith a major slice you can wind a cloth tape, like gaffer tape, around both the wheel rim and the tire, going between the spokes. This will bind everything together. Yes you will be riding on tape for part of the wheel rotation but it will get you down the road. \nA good reason to carry a spare tire is if you are running an odd size diameter of tire, that most shops will not stock and might need a special order (delivery times may hurt your schedule).</div>","author":"Mark Perry","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_86798","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mark Perry\"> I have some side wall repair supplies with me but not seen the boot which is pretty cool!
