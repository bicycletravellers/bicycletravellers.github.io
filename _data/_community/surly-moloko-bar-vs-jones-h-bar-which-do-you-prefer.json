The moloko tends to push you more into a forward lean,  similar to a road bike geometry when used on the same stem as the jones bar. I didn't find them as comfortable as the Jones. I now use neither and have swapped to the Koga Denham which puts you more upright like an mtb bar,  but the back sweep is perfect and the hand position on the forward lean is so comfortable. All are oddly expensive! If you run a front rack and basket setup both Jones and Moloko bars push the cables into the front basket area which is also super annoying! Just depends how you set your sweet rig up!</div>","author":"Wayne M","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_217696","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/surly-moloko-bar-vs-jones-h-bar-which-do-you-prefer/image_1655212641_1810069828.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Wayne M","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_657377","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Wayne M\"> thanks for the information</span></div>","author":"Michael Shireman","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_268973","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Michael Shireman\"> absolute pleasure üôè  best of luck! üòÑ</span></div>","author":"Wayne M","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_786133","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Wayne M\"> I second the Denham bars.
