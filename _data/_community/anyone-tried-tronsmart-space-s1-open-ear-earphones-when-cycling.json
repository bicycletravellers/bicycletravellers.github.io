I have no expericence with these headsets, but they are not bone conducting and so the sound will be mostly travelling through air, unlike buds which fit directly into the ear canal (which acts like a bass bin). The IPX5 rating is not too encouraging, I would want IPX6 if I was going to ride and use these in the rain. \n\nLike you say, cheap enough to give them a go, but I have tried cheap bone conducting phones and they are ok.

My Aftershoks don't do well for phone calls. The other side has always difficulty in understanding me, but I don't know if that's the case just for mine or all. I had other bone conducting headphones before I got the Aeropex, from Aftershoks (I had a Titanium) and other brands. The unknown brand seemed to perform slightly better than the Titanium for phone calls, but sound quality was far inferior.

The Shokz works well on noisy roads. I see in your picture that the version also has holes. So maybe this is also a so called bone conduction headphone.
