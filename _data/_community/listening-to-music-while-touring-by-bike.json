I would like to hear other people‚Äôs experiences comparing different audio options as well. \nI now own Bluetooth in-ear phones, bone conduction phones, and a Bluetooth speaker. All of which I have used on the bike. Here are my personal thoughts/findings. \nIn-ear phones, are not advisable for riding. However, great for keeping out unwanted noise in restaurants, walking around, or relaxing in public areas. The dynamic range can also be pretty good, even with mid-priced phones.\nBone induction phones. These do not have a good dynamic range, the bass is especially weak. But for general listening they are ok.They are easily audible at low volumes. To some degree these open phones can be used to isolate outside unwanted noise if they are played at the loud end of things. This is because my brain will focus on the strongest noise. However, that can be a negative thing, because if the music is played at higher volumes I cannot hear traffic approaching from behind until it is close, and if the music is loud very close. When noisy vehicles pass, they will drown out the music. The bone induction phones are also expensive and even the most expensive have a limited dynamic range.\nBluetooth speaker. I mount mine on the handlebars with the speaker facing me. Although my speaker is only mono and pretty cheap, the dynamic range is pretty good. It was also the cheapest of the options. I can play music very loud and still hear traffic approaching from behind. Noisy vehicles will drown out the music. The downside is that you cannot listen privately, you can annoy other people, and they take up space on the handlebars.\n\nAlthough I like my new Shokz Open Run phones, I am torn and may well go back to using my Bluetooth speaker on the road, or at least keep it handy as an option for busier roads.\n \nWhat did you find using your music options?</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_833777","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_831225","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Pretty much what I experience too.
