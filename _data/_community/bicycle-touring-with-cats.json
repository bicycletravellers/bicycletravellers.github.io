Its best to keep them in a front basket.  There are several bicycle basket that are made for cat and small dogs. You cud also use a backpack carrier.

(Go slow or walk your bike) If they meow a lot, you should try petting or talking to your cat.  Because of the heat, you might want to put a ice pack with your cat, to keep them cool. Keep them on a harness and leash at all times, because they cud get scared and run off.
