The idea is to have plenty of space between the rain shell and your under &amp; mid-layer garments.  This lessens sweating and lessens direct moisture transfer from the outer shell.   The stiffer the outer shell layer the more air space in your undergarments.  Think like an umbrella except for more wind-accepting!
