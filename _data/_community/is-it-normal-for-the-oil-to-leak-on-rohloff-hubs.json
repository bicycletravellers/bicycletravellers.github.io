I seem to remember Rohloff being quite explicit about this somewhere in their manual so I never have. I even try and park it with the oil drain grub screw on the casing uppermost and never had a problem. Maybe the seals on your hub need renewal? Email Rohloff to see what they suggest.

While the <b>hubs leak SLIGHTLY when the seals are still fine</b>, the leakage will slowly increase over time as the seals wear. So you may want to schedule seal replacement sometime after you return from your trip. It isn’t a risk to the hub that some oil leaks out—there will be plenty of lubricant since the hub does not require a full load of oil. One other factor to possibly be aware of…if you’re using a Gates belt, for years Gates was specifying much higher belt tension than what is actually needed—they have since lowered the belt tension spec. If you’ve been running too high belt tension for a while it may have damaged your hub bearings, so if you schedule a seal replacement, (which will likely require returning your wheel to a Rohloff service center) you may also want to change the bearings at the same time.</div>",
