Apart from the crossings close to the Atlantic Ocean (which I don't know) the by far easiest crossing is the one between Le Perthus &amp; La Jonquera, north of Girona. Maximum elevation is about 250m if I remember correctly. However, this is a main road, in parallel to the (toll) highway, and additionally Le Perthus is a duty-free place, with lots of people going there by car for shopping. So if you go there expect it to be easy to cross but very unpleasant. On the catalonian side you have the following options to cross: One at Cerebre/Port Bou (next to the sea, very nice views, not too high, ), one between La Vajol &amp; Ceret (medium high, very secondary road, last bits very steep, some 500m of unpaved road directly over the boarder, very nice countryside), one between Massanet de Cabrenys &amp; Coustouge (medium high, good road, not very steep), one between Prats-de-Mollo &amp; Camprodon (high - 1500m pass, good road, medium steep from the French side but not too steep from the Spanish side), one at Puigcerdá (not very high, main road with some traffic, but you will most likely have to cross other passes on both sides to get there), one through Andorra (highest pass in the Pyrenees, 2400m, main road with a lot ot traffic throughout the whole of Andorra) and one at Vall d'Aran (which is a beautiful valley but it is closed of on the Spanish side, you you need another pass or put the bike on a bus to get through the tunnel (bikes forbidden) to Pont de Suert. I think I haven't forgotten any. Then there is more ones in the central Pyrenees of Aragon (should be high/very high without an exception, and the ones towards the Atlantic which I don't know.</span></div>","author":"Hajo Reuter","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_852604","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I don't think they are the same thing?</div>","author":"Rob Howard","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_239584","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">either end by the seas you can cross quietly only going to about 600 m high and away from the coastal traffic</div>","author":"Kevin Allerton","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_798816","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I recently cycled this route in the video below.
