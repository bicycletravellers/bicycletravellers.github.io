The panniers, trunks bags, and pretty much everything but water bottles, and the tiny underseat repair kit need to come off. Often, the front wheel needs to come off, so have a hex tool if that will be required. The bags can almost always go onto a very nearby luggage rack or the shelf above the seats. ￼if you can lift the fully loaded bike onto the train, do that, and then pull off the luggage and toss it into a luggage area. \n\nYou should feel lucky getting this arrangement as otherwise, I’ve been left holding my bike upright where a wheelchair should go for hours at a time.

That time they told me to lean it against the wall in the luggage car (still fully loaded). Each time i was told to lay it down,, i removed my panniers and set them next to my bike.. this was not because i was told to but because i didn't want my bike laying on top of my panniers and then the connecting points might break with all the weight on top of them (i took them off because of personal preference). The last time,, qhen I was told to leave the bike standing,, i fully expected it to have been thrown onto its side during the trip (the train is very bumpy and jerks around a lot).
