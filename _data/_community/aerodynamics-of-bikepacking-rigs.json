Think about all the headwinds, for one. Also, anytime you ride faster than 12km/h aero has a bigger impact than rolling resistance.\n\nI´m by no means an expert but I´d like to share a bit about what I´ve learned recently, and maybe we can come up with good ideas and solutions together?\n\nFirst I´d like to invite more people to consider aero bars.\n\nThey really help you stay in a relaxed, supported aero shape and can save HUGE amounts of watts.\nPeople think they´re heavy but people also use heavy front harnesses and strap wide front rolls to them that cause insane amounts of drag. \nIn a wind tunnel they tested a tiny 2.5l front bag and at only 25km/h it added 8.5W of drag, which is huge, and at faster speeds that number rises exponentially! \nImagine how much drag the huge rolls/bags people use cause then.\nIf you mount aero bars, you can easily attach a dry bag inline instead and don´t need the extra weight of a harness. If you use a tapered dry bag, instead of it slowing you down immensely, it may actually make you faster!\n\nCyclite has a 5l semi rigid aero front bag that has been tested to make you faster. \nI have an Alpkit 13l tapered dry bag that I´m going to try to use to get the same effect. I´m also considering ordering another one to put on the bag stabilizer in the back. There I´d have the tapered end facing back, and this should help clean up the airflow and make me faster as well.\nGoing to put an old top tube bag underneath my Ortlieb fram bag and fill that space better. Then strap something to the downtube and fill up the remaining room in the triangle,\n\nTheoretically then, I´d have the front tapered dry bag gently cut the wind, sending it around the bike. Then the filled triangle keeps the wind flowing reasonably smoothly to the back where the rear tapered dry bag smooths it out more and gently releases it. \nMy moving legs get in the way of course but I can´t do much about that :)\n\nI hope and believe that this system will make me more aero than having no bags at all on the bike, something which cannot be said for most setups.\n\nPutting 32mm Schwalbe Pro One road racing tyres with latex tubes on the bike so I can be faster on the road and light gravel. \nPlanning to carry my XC tires as well and eventually do 200km road rides to the mountains and then do trail riding with the XC tyres there.\n\nThoughts, ideas?\n\nI have more to write but don´t want to make the post too long :)<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_album_attachment\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/aerodynamics-of-bikepacking-rigs/image_1655746145_6726025218.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/aerodynamics-of-bikepacking-rigs/image_1655746145_9470347368.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_559992","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_671726","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Just keep pedaling.✌️</div>","author":"Marcus Murray","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_281318","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Peter Gargano\"> , this is up your alley🤔</span></div>","author":"Jason Bachmann","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_969668","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">No setup will make you faster than a clean bike, that’s for sure. \n\nAs far as the framebag goes, it’s definitely more streamlined than things sticking out, but you can’t just ignore the turbulence your legs will create.\n\nUltralight wise, I think carrying a set of tires in addition to the ones on your bike kinda misses the whole point.\n\nAt the end of the day, as far as Bikepacking and touring goes, we spend a huge amount of the day pedaling pretty slow, at speeds that aerodynamics don’t affect us too much (yea, even in Bikepacking races, 17 kph would be pretty impressive). Because of that, weight and comfort are soooo much more important and I would focus mostly on those.</div>","author":"Avi Fried","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_27974","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Avi Fried\">  I disagree with most of the things you wrote, but lets discuss and see if we both can´t benefit from it.\n\n\"No setup will make you faster than a clean bike, that’s for sure. \"\nThis is just plain wrong. Think about velomobiles, and different fairings for both recumbents and upright bikes. This makes a bike MUCH faster than just a clean frame. They already tested the Cyclite aero front bag combined with the Tailfin rerar rack and dry bag, and that was faster than a clean bike.\nHaving a textured surface like my suggested drybags is not nearly as good as a smooth surface of course, but the principle is still the same. You just have to work with what you´ve got.\n\nI want to have a full road experience on the road and a full trail experience on the trail so therefore 2 sets of tyres. They´re both pretty light so it´s no big deal. Only bringing both sets on multi day trips.\n\nBikepacking can be so many things and I definitely plan on going fast with my road tyres but I´d argue that aero is always important, for the reasons decribed earlier.\n\nAlso, aero bars ARE about comfort. For me they´re a resting position that also happens to make me more aero. You don´t need to be in a super aggressive TT position to reap the benefits.\n\nAbout weight. My aero bars weigh 500g and the tapered 13l dry bag weighs 150g. The aero bars give endless advantages, whereas sometimes people use harnesses that weigh the same and only serve one purpose.</span></div>","author":"Mikael Angel Oh","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_589034","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mikael\">, pro skinsuits now have textured surfaces, not unlike a golf ball, because smoother isn't always faster.</span></div>","author":"Jeremy Lawrence","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_383915","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Something I noticed last Autumn on a really wet long weekend was my fork bags kept the worst of it off my feet and low legs.

I already had most of the special parts I put on it.\nSince I already have 2 drop bar bikes, I wanted a flat bar bike now, and am working around the limitations of it when setting it up for long road rides.

There´s gonna be very little, and light stuff in it, and the tapered end will be filled with bubble wrap so it always keeps its shape. This way I can extend it as far back as possible without it affecting bike handling and without any sway, as it will be securely strapped to the bag support. I don´t sit on the last 5cm of the ISM saddle either so the front of the bag can  extend onto the saddle and remind me not to sit too far back.\nIn one of the wind tunnel videos they mentioned that the Tailfin bag would be even more aero if it was higher up, so that´s what I´m doing. I´ve learned a lot in a very short time and there´s still so much more to be learned, but I have faith in the system I´m building. The photo was taken after I got home from a bike fit yesterday and the guy who did it is also an aero coach and he seemed to believe in my plan as well. With the aero bars turned up like this I can get into the praying mantis position and almost hide my head behind my hands, being very aero. The tapered bag in the front will extend out in front of the aero bars a bit as well as well and guide the wind around me. This is an XL frame meant for people up to 2m, and I´m only 187cm, but have such a long torso and arms that it turns into a relaxed, pretty upright aero bar position, but I can sink my head down inbetween my shoulders when I want a more streamlined position.</span></div>","author":"Mikael Angel Oh","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_160519","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mikael Angel Oh\"> I'll try again.

You don't need a super aggressive time trial position. A relaxed aero bar position is super comfortable. It's a resting position for me.\nAnd aero is much more than just body position, even though that's the biggest factor \nWhen more people realise just how much drag handlebar bags and rolls create, we're gonna see a change in how we carry bags. Even if you just used aero bars as an attachment point for mounting a dry bag inline and nothing else, that would still make you more efficient, especially if using a tapered dry bag. When you add the resting position and huge watt savings of being in aero bars, it becomes a no brainer. And aero bars' weight is pretty close to the weight of many handlebar harnesses people use.\nI focused on the aero discussion in my post, but the main point of focus for this bike is long distance COMFORT.\nI've got a Kinekt suspension seatpost that allows me to stay seated over bumps and saves both my ass and legs. A supremely comfortable noseless ISM saddle, front suspension, and that resting position in the aero bars.</span></div>","author":"Mikael Angel Oh","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_621825","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mikael Angel Oh\"> / aero bars for comfort to unweight hands yes… and correct there are more aero bag setup… but the point was aero is nothing if you aren’t comfy… and a great deal of bikepacking (offroad) is not something you want to in the aerobars… at least from my perspective.

It felt unnatural somehow, but in the aero bars I´m very comfortable. Since you´ve raced TT I imagine your idea of an aero bar position is a lot more extreme than mine so I understand where you´re coming from, but I´m far, far away from having a horizontal back. Even though I´m on a really big mtb frame and my seat is higher than the aero bars, my torso and arms are so long that it turns into a fairly upright, comfortable position anyway.\nI´m gonna practice sinking my head between my shouders so I can get low when I really want and need to but the base postion is really comfortable.\nI have the aero bars turned upwards so I should be able to get into the praying mantis postion if I really try and be super efficient. The tapered drybag under the aero bars should help with the efficiency as well. It´s a 20 dollar dry bag, so it´s not like this is some big expensive endevour. I´m just putting thought into it and will hopefully be rewarded with a fairly slippery(considering it´s a mtb) bike that´s still very comfortable 🙂</span></div>","author":"Mikael Angel Oh","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_248777","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mikael Angel Oh\"> / yeah, bikepacking can be everything from a packhorse expedition to sleek überlight road setup.</span></div>","author":"Robert Biron","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_961321","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I also have a 29er frame I'm using in a more road type scenario.

Couple of things:\n\n- regardless of shaving weight or making your bike Aero, those suspensions on your MT will waste a lot of your energy while paddling.\n\n- unlike the general assumption, Aero bars do not always add comfort. They add extra hand position (useful for super long rides) and aerodynamics, but that doesn't always mean comfort. The main two problem with Aerobar are 1) reducing access to the horizontal portion of handle bar. Mine is Flip Ergo 50a which at least doesn't have this problem, but still 2) Aero bars generally need a different saddle position compared to normal (and drop bar) riding. The saddle needs to be a bit move forward and tiny bit head down. In general a normal bike fit and saddle position is not very comfortable for Aero bar and vice versa a bike fit and saddle position for Aero bar is not comfortable (and fit!) for normal position.\n- the general thing you mentioned about aerodynamics is correct and there are plenty thing online (from cyclingabout and other resources) on this. But 1) anytime you move weight away from rear tire to the front of the bike, you are reducing traction on the rear wheel which is the main place for forward move force 2) comfort of access also affect the overall time. If bike packing setup need 3% less Watts than rear panniers, but with rear Pannier you can access things more quickly or have fewer stops because you can carry slightly more nutilrition, than it will depend on the route and your speed characteristics which one will take less time overall. 3) as you reduce your overall gear capacity, then you have to carry less and less and (more importantly) smaller and smaller stuff. That can quickly skyrocket the cost of your gears. e.g. instead of sleeping bag you already have, need to get a lighter smaller one, same for cooking, same for tent, etc. \n\nAll above said, I agree with you that between aerodynamics and weight, in majority of cases aerodynamics is more important and shaving of 1kg of gear does not have as big an effect as people think. But at the end comfort is the most important factor to me in long rides: comfort &gt; aerodynamics &gt; weight.</span></div>","author":"Mohammad Afshar","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_660307","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mohammad Afshar\"> There's a lot to address here and not that much time to do it, but I'll start now and finish later today.\n\nSure, the susp fork wastes some energy but mostly I have it locked out so not a big deal. It's mostly gonna be used for steeper trail stuff.\n\nLimited access to horizontal area of handlebar I agree is a con. It makes it harder to fit stem bags and such, but not impossible.\n\nIn my opinion normal bike saddles are dangerous, so that's why I use an ISM saddle, which also takes care of the issue with saddle position with the aero bars as I can easily scoot forward on it and be very comfortable or sit further back and be equally comfortable in a more upright mtb position. Most importantly, no restricted blood flow and numbing, so no danger to my reproductive organs.\n\nBikepacking bags don in general force you to take less and lighter stuff yes, but that's a good thing, as it means your bike will handle better and your riding will be more enjoyable. Remember that we're in an UL bikepacking group now, so I spoke to an audience that already thinks about that balance.\nFor this bike, I need to both be aero and fast for long road stretches as well as having the weight weil balanced so I can do more technical mountain biking. The front and rear bags are just for very light sleep/camp stuff, so all the weight is as centered as possible and everything I need to access during the day is also in the center of the bike  \n\nI agree comfort is most important. It doesn't have to be at the expense of aero though. The main goal of this build is comfort and so far it seens to be working well. To me though, there's a difference between comfort and lazyness. The fact that you have to plan the setup and use it in specific ways isn't uncomfortable. It's just being deliberate in how you do things, in order to reap the rewards.</span></div>","author":"Mikael Angel Oh","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_930565","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">You guys got me thinking about the whole rigid fork thing. \n\nWhen I bought this bike I was planning on heading to trail centres and doing more downhill oriented stuff and in general using it as a mountain bike, so the suspension fork made sense. \nNow though, I´m not sure that´s what I want to do, as riding it has reminded me that I still lean more towards the fast long distance stuff on road and gravel. Therefore, I ordered a Toseek carbon fork that will save me a full 2kg!\nWith this weight saving I may start thinking about entering some races as well as it´s now not a super heavy bike anymore. It started as a 600 euro 14kg bike that I bought just to have a bike, as I couldn´t get to my gravel bike because of pandemic travel restrictions. Almost straight away though, I got excited and it snowballed into what this post is about, but I always had the feeling that I was putting a lot of effort into a cheap, heavy bike. Shaving 2kg off it makes it feel more reasonable. It´s still a budget build, but the thought and planning that has gone into it is making it a really nice bike once I have all parts in place.</div>","author":"Mikael Angel Oh","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_270413","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Mine was similar in a way.
