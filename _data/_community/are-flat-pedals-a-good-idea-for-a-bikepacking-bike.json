A quality pedal like the Yoshimura’s will likely last you a lifetime and offer you piece of mind that they’re not going to fail or cause you any trouble, especially while you’re in the midst of a bikepacking adventure. I also really like the Shimano Saint flat pedals. I have two pairs of the first generation ones. They’re probably 15+ years old and have been absolutely trouble free. Or if you’re not looking to spend a whole lot on intro to flats, I think these by PNW will be thought to beat, especially for the price. They’re also fully serviceable and rebuildable too and that’s not something you see on very many pedals in this price range.\n\n<a href=\"https://bikepacking.com/news/check-out-the-new-pnw-range-pedal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bikepacking.com/news/check-out-the-new-pnw-range-pedal/</a></span></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbikepacking.com%2Fnews%2Fcheck-out-the-new-pnw-range-pedal%2F&amp;h=AT3xqMc_HWohKTV_ljwr5rY2Atk5h1nMqghV3yJ16chiN8otRK6T4DwthF6hMu5qg2W8pJusBhqU5zxdmRufuvmA36LziXKijroHminLr7t8Q4jMMWQ9aIJTKKTWaH_ysB-m05kBxDPd3AE&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/PNW-Range-Pedal-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Check out the new PNW Range Pedal</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">bikepacking.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Eric Yantis","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_836205","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Eric Yantis\">, great info, thanks!

You can get larger or smaller sizes of these pedals (110's, 100's, 90's), and you can also replace the pins with a smaller 7mm size if you want. The 100's are great for my size 9 shoe but could accomodate larger. I am not missing clipless shoes/pedals at all and like the flexibility of a flat pedal/flat pedal shoes for bikepacking/touring. They are thin, mildly concave, a good weight, and feel terrific under foot. You can spend more money and get fancier pedals, but these are well priced right now through Amazon. Found them for $69 in black with some digging around.</div>","author":"Hope W.
