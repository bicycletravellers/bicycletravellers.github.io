Literally at the lowest point of the frame. All the weight you are carrying is much higher and is leaning to one side adding more pressure and stress. Every little twist, gust of wind, or the wrong touch, and the bike goes down. Eventually either the kick stand breaks or the frame gets messed up.\n\nSolution: get a retractable hiking pole to use as a kickstand. Set the stick to reach the seat. The higher the contact point, the higher the center of mass moves, the more stable your bike will be. Put the hiking pole hand loop through the seat for extra security so it can't slip or slide. Bike will never fall again or break. For added security, lock the breaks of both wheels by wrapping a rubber band round the handbrake and the handlebar. This keeps bike from micro movements that will cause to the bike to fall.\n\n*Hiking pole can be used for as many things as you are creative but more importantly, to keep the chasing dog at bay.\n\nYou could buy the click-stand (Google it). It's the same idea but for an UL solution. It works great for small light tours. I am on 2nd tour around the world. I currently have 42kg (bike + everything before food and water). In the beginning of my 1st tour I broke 2 click-stands before I switched to a hiking pole and never had problems since.</div>","author":"Adir Sharon","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_730778","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Adir Sharon\"> click stand does make a heavier duty version.</span></div>","author":"Brett Mitchell","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_258143","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Brett Mitchell\"> they were the max version :( it's still a great product that I recommend to people while on the road that carry less then me.

I felt too dumb to mention it again feeling like I'll be taking advantage of you! \n\nAfter I lost the first one, within a week of my ride, you were kind enough to ship me one free of charge! 2 weeks after I got that one, the ground was too soft, the stand dug into the ground, the bike dropped and bent the stand out of commission. Ordered a new one through a friend because I was too embarrassed. That one too buckled one day when the winds were insane. It wasn't bent too badly at first but it lost its integrity. A few days later, the road provided me with a collapsible hiking pole I found on the side of the road. Used it in conjunction until I lost the 3rd click-stand on a bumpy downhill path. At a Harley shop I got a plastic kick stand plate to avoid further kickstands from breaking through the soft grounds.\n\nDespite my bad luck, I still recommend your product and kindness all the time!</span></div>","author":"Adir Sharon","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_552518","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Adir Sharon\"> I'm glad you found something to carry on.
