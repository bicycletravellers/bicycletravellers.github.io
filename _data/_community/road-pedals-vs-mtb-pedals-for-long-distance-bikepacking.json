Particularly if you get some of the downhill / enduro style ones with a large flat platform around the mechanism. Road clips are solely focussed on efficiency on the bike. That‚Äôs not what bike packing is about. You‚Äôll have a terrible time with road pedals. A lot of people like the crank bros mallet DH or Mallet E. They have a lot of float which I personally hate (I ride flats with 5:10s &amp; when you put your foot down it does not move a mm) but they are nicer on your knees on longer rides &amp; easy to get in &amp; out of than shimanos. Probably more important is shoes. You don‚Äôt want a super hard soled cross country race style shoe as they‚Äôre a bitch to walk in. You may not fall over as much as in a road shoe but you don‚Äôt want to walk far in them. Again the shoes that are more aimed at the downhill segment would be more suitable. I imagine you‚Äôd find the leisure shoes too flexible coming from road riding but some of the DH shoes are pretty stiff but still have a recessed cleat &amp; a sole pattern with actual rubber, rather than hard plastic.
