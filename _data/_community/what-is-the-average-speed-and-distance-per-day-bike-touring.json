Or you're into racing, which has little to do with touring. I sometimes \"brag\" about the kms I've done over the 11 years I've been a nomadic cyclist/translator and language teacher (+/- 48.000 km, though I could be a thousand or more kms off, it's not so exact) and the number of countries (38 cycling many more without cycling), but I do it more than anything else to (maybe?) connect with like-minded people, or to define my lifestyle, I guess. To calculate a day's ride (just as an example) I figure 10 km/hr, that is, if I want to do 60 km or 80 km, then I figure I will be on the road some 6 or 8 hours. My average when touring is a about 70 km/day, though recently it went down to 40 km/day, in Mexico. 10 km per hour, including stops for photos, snacks, even long stops for lunch, drying out the gear, etc. When touring, I average 1.000 km/month, sometimes only 600 km, sometimes 1.500 km. It all depends. There's the weather, the terrain (flat/mountainous), my condition, my work load (I bike and work at the same time), and especially the season of the year, as the daylight hours in summer are way more than in winter! I think the only point to this post (hopefully) is to realize that there are as many answers as there are people. Each person finds out what is \"right\" for them, or what has been typical (average), and even that is relative because it changes! So there's not much significant to be said in the end, is there?
