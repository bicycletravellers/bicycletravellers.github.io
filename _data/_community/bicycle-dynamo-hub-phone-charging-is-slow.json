I usually use it for light (Edelux) but I have used it for phone charging through a 'sinewave' box quite successfully.  I've never had any problems, but I'm very realistic regarding the phone charging.  My phone has a 10,000mAh battery, so a 10% increase in charge over a few hours cycling is good.  It depends on you phone's battery capacity as to how good an increase from 22 to 46% actually is.  To muddy the waters further, it also depends whether you actually use the phone whilst you are riding, for example map/gps.  In the past, I've been happy with drawing even over a day's touring - if I start the day with say 50% battery capacity, use the phone all day for gps/map and finish the day with 50%, then that's a win for me.  Maybe I'm not cycling fast enough!  Hope this helps, I wouldn't get too hung up on % figures.</div>","author":"Alistair Watt","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_545477","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">The Forumslader.de and Cinq Plug are the most efficient generators when used with son hub.

A Schmidt dyno hub only produces 3 watts.  The new iPhones come with an 18 watt charger.  My Motorola uses a 10 watt charger for fast charging.  So even without the lights on, I would expect slow charging.  If you have the lights on, I'd be surprised if you did any better than just keeping the phone from discharging.\n\nWith battery capacities increasing on phones and higher wattage chargers used to facilitate faster charging, I've given up on charging my phone with my bike and just carry a big battery pack as I get several charges out of it before I need to find a place to plug it in overnight.</div>","author":"Tom Chandler","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_484454","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">StVZO compliant dynamos need to be able to produce 3 W at 15 km/h.

Getting a higher quality USB charger may boost performance by 10-15%, but nothing major. The main bottleneck is that dynamo hubs are designed around 20+-year-old power standards made for lights, not USB devices.
