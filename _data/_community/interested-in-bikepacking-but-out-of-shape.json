Don't use the forward/backward adjustment as a main way to adjust leg reach (although you may need to go back to this if you change much).   Total bike fitting can be an art, and might be worth investing paying for at a local bike shop.  I generally do it myself and tinker a lot on rides until it feels right.  All this said, my original comment was mainly about seat height which is easy to play with.  Often if its even a bit too low, it robs your strength as if you were trying to walk around for a while in bent-leg crouch.  The other stuff (seat angle/ forward-backward adjustment) tends to be more about arms/neck/shoulder pain.   Other basic tip-- remember to use your gears.  Expect to use them so that you are peddling relatively fast and without too much power.  Think light jog, not squats.</span></div>","author":"Stephen Feeley","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_162541","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Stephen Feeley\"> thanks a lot for all these tips.

It doesn't take into account thickness of heel of shoe, your foot size or how your ball of foot relates to heel when you pedal. It's very inaccurate for me. \n\nThere is no simple quick answer. You also need to get your saddle fore/aft position setup correctly. \nYou are best raising saddle with ball of foot over pedal axle until your knee is not quite straightened fully. From there adjust up or down by small increments and riding to see what works best for you. If my saddle is just 2mm lower than normal, I feel like I'm tired on bike. \nSaddle fore/aft position should result in front of knee cap being over pedal axle when cranks are horizontal. Again slightly fore of back of this may work better for yourself. \nI prefer to pedal with ball of foot much lower than heel. Not the same as pointing toes downwards. Try walking upstairs [same basic biomechanical action for downstroke] with a lower than usual or even level heel/ball and you will quickly see how efficiency varies.</div>","author":"Jeremy Lawrence","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_271496","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Start slow and add 5-10 minutes each day or</div>","author":"Andrew Mackey","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_52122","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Keep at it, do a little more every day.
