I’ve narrowed down to the Trek Checkpoint 6 eTap and the Specialized Diverge Carbon Comp. Local shops have both in stock in my size. I plan to use as a more comfortable road bike that can hit some dirt and gravel too. \n\nTrek has SRAM Rival eTap 1 x 12 and a sweet paint job 🙂 Specialized has SRAM Rival mechanical 1 x 11 and uses the same carbon as their Pro series. Future Shock 2.0 has lockout to turn on/off. \n\nBoth bike have lots of mounts and fit me well. I have done business with both shops in the past but have a better relationship with the Specialized dealer. Can anyone speak to experience with these bike or point out anything else I should consider?

Any of the big name bike manufacturers bikes will be fine, but for what you are planning a double front ring would be the best choice. My gravel bike has a 48/31 front rings and 11-34 on the rear cassette. I bought mine with 650b x 47 tires for the smoothest ride possible because I have a bad shoulder injury but 700c x 42 would also be good as a gravel and touring bike. With my Kona, I regularly ride pavement with it too with lightly treaded tires. I regularly ride 60 to 80 km exercise rides on it and would not hesitate to tour across North America on it. The fatter tires give comfort and stability no matter the riding surface. The double front rings give great cruising speeds on the flats and the ability to pedal downhill and not run out of gears but also provides good climbing gears too. I recommend calculating gear inches for the tire size and gears on bikes you are considering to help with your decision.</span></div>","author":"Todd McKinnon","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_739483","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Drew Harris\"> I have attached a gear inches calculator that lists my four bikes, my wife Elaine's hybrid and my sister-in-law, Nancy's gravel bike.

Notice mountain bikes get down to 18 gear inches, while the gravel bikes get down to around 24 for climbing but up to 115 for top gear. Notice my mountain bike with only one front ring at 32 is only 85 gear inches which is not great for the road or touring. The old vintage Rocky Mountain Hammer Race that has the old style triple front rings gets up over 100 gear inches.
