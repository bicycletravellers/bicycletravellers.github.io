Chocolate digestives are my Kryptonite - I can easily put away a pack in an evening, with a few mugs of tea (and yet I am still losing weight!).\nWhile riding - whatever carbs you can lay your hands on. Cereal bars, jelly sweets, malt loaves, even bread. Aldi/Lidl do all of the above that don't break the bank (you are likely to need them in some quantity), but further out, smaller shops have a lot less of a choice. \nIf it's hot, you need electrolytes, or you'll be drinking non-stop; and you're the one carrying the water!

In the UK with enough research you can find somewhere nice to eat every night if your budget allows. Ex forces so i have had my fill of eating ration pack style ready meals. They might give you enough calories but they taste like a dogs dinner a lot of the time and after a few days you really need something nice.
