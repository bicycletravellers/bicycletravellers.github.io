How much do you want it to carry?  I’ve got a bob yak16 which has been in action since 1996.  I’ve used that trailer,  panniers and rackless  bikepacking setups.  I have found that my trailer is a big headache off road when lifting my bike over an obstacle,  crossing water,  singletrack and weighs about 13lb EMPTY (which is about the weight of ALL of my gear before food and water on an off-road bike trip).  Care looking at my gear that I bring significantly reduces the amount that i need to haul.  I weigh EVERYTHING that I bring from bike shorts to my sleeping kit.  A king size seatbag 25+ liter and big bags on the fork legs such as Roadrunner’s buoy bag at 7.75 liter each side allow a bit more capacity.  I like my trailer for urban hauling but wouldn’t use it for a bike trip without a bunch of hesitation.</div>","author":"Mike Krasovec","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
