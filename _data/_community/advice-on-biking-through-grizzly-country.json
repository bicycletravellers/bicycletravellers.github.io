You want the bear to know you're coming rather than take one by surprise. \n\n2) No food or anything scented in your tent. No toothpaste, no snacks, etc.\n\n3) Hang your food (away from your tent) - better yet a bear canister or bear box (if you stay at a campground that has em') \n\n4) I carry a road flare with me- in my head it makes sense as a deterrent to something big like a bear or a wild boar.. but I haven't had to light it yet. They're cheap and lightweight and I keep one in the extra outside pocket of my pannier. \n\n5) Don't cook near your tent and don't get food on your clothing.

She was not impressed and just continued eating, I wasn't sure about a momma bear and I made noise to announce my presence..... No response.... So, I rode forward to the bear, and, as I approached within about 20 feet I hollered, the bear turned and launched itself into the trunk of a tree, hanging on about two feet above ground.....I would have stopped and played with the little bear but.....

EVERY creature in existence can attune to the Spirit, and it is our only real \"defense\" that allows us to communicate with all life forms in this chronically ill world. Learn to speak the divine language and not fear death, otherwise the critters will sense it and there will always be animosity between species. \n\nGuns do nothing except taint the conscience (if it's even present), and make things exponentially worse for everyone in the long run. I've personally been unarmed and in close proximity with many of these magnificent creatures, and can say emphatically that they are far more receptive to kindness than we've been led to believe. Use \"common\" sense though and keep all of your food in special containers designed to keep smells in and bears out, and show utmost respect for their homes as you would expect anyone else to show in yours. But if you insist on a weapon, I'd recommend getting a can of bear spray and only use it when absolutely necessary. \n\nThe blue plastic container on my rig is a BV500 bear vault, and has become a permanent and indispensable part of my setup. There are others of varying shapes and sizes, but I've grown quite fond of this one because it's a great place to do laundry and also makes a nifty drum when empty. Not to mention that it holds a considerable amount of food, and after several years of owning it there have been zero instances of critters ravaging the food supply. It's also got 4 grooves around the center for attaching rope, so it can be hung from a tree when necessary.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/advice-on-biking-through-grizzly-country/image_1657808425_987940329.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"William Pearson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_858619","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">You can follow all the great advice above but I can promise you this… despite all the bells &amp; whistles; the sprays and whatnot… the first thing you will reach for will be your camera! 😂🤣🐻🚴🏼‍♂️</div>","author":"Chris Rumbelow","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_847288","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I just rode (last summer)across Wa, Id, Mt (Missoula) down the Bitter roots, thru Yellowstone.

All that to say, we heard about bear issues around us before and after and the only bear encounter we had was in Yellowstone where a large Black bear popped out 100' in front us. He wasn't interested in us. We kept our bear spray in our front bottle holder so it was close, we camped bear smart and asked the good Lord to keep us safe. Don't sleep with ANYTHING smellable in your tent. Candy,gum,toothpaste, deodorant, nothing! Store it in a tree at least 100 yds from your tent.

The only time I’ve experienced a bear on-trail while riding was right at dusk- when they tend to be arousing from naps and starting to forage. Having encountered Grizzlies in the greater Yellowstone area, I’ve had only 1 approach my tent at night, and he made a LOT of noise- sniffing and grunting. Rarely are they aggressive, in spite of the sensationalized stories you read and hear of. Instead, on trails while hiking, I’ve encountered bears who were quite aloof and seemed to find me nothing but an annoyance. While traveling/camping in bear country, make sure to hang my food bag about 50 yards from my tent, as high up in a tree as I could get it was important.</div>","author":"Val Boggs","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_702033","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Cook a mile or so down the trail away from where you will be sleeping.

I've ridden / camped plenty in bear country. I follow this strict regimen: 1) about an hour or so before I intend to stop riding and camp, I stop and do all my cooking. 2) Do all necessary cleanup of dishes, cooking gear. 3) Pack any unused food back into bear-safe container (I have also used marine, water-tight, roll-top bag for this). 4) Pack any trash into another airtight bag / container. 5) Get back on the road and ride for another hour. 6) BEFORE setting up camp, find a spot to store bear-safe food container at least 100 meters from camp site. 7) Store trash container 100 meters in different direction. This sounds like a lot of trouble but, like all camping tasks on the road, it gets easier once you establish the habit. Following this regimen I haven't had a single unpleasant or scary bear incident in the wild. In my tent I keep the bear spray and mini compressed air foghorn close at hand but I've never had occasion to use either.</div>","author":"Robert Tolar","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_436132","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Hygiene is as important as keeping your food stuff and shaving kit up high and out of your tent at night</div>","author":"Reid Dryden","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
