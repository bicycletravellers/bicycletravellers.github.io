Auchus\"> for sure equipment and technique vary and produce diff results.  I thought you were maybe being cautious, but if you’re already getting glaze then should look at equipment options like you are.  Should first change to sintered / metal pads.  Organics are often OEM bc they are quieter, have good feel, and wear your rotors more slowly.  Sintered are more heat resistant and can handle harder use without glazing though.  If that doesn’t do the job, next more expensive step is larger diameter rotors, prob only need front.  Beyond that maybe change to 4 piston brakes.</span></div>","author":"Dave Wright","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_296086","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Additional comment.
