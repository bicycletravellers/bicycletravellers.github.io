But if you keep low or ask owner you will not have problems. Summer is very hot. From 11 h till 16 h is almost impossible to cycle. Traffic depends. In general avoid main turist areas and roads on Fridays and Saturdays. In Slovenia you will find heavy traffic only on the main roads to the border with Croatia. I see that you plan to cross Učka pass in Istria, you will walk a bit because is steep as ....It is better to go a bit north. Over Lika in Croatia you will not have much traffic. In Bosnia, especially in Hercegovina part also. Avoid coastal road in Montenegro, in summer it is a jam. North parth of Albania is a bit tricky to navigate. They are transforming a state road into a highway. Use euro velo. From Vlore to Sarande it will be the ride of the lifetime. In general you will meet a lot of friendly people, who will help you.
