It is true that if I wear rubber boots when walking I am better protected against being struck by lightening. Being struck by lightening is about the same odds as death from  cycling WHEN NO MOTOR VEHICLE IS INVOLVED! So you want me to wear a helmet, first because you think they protect...they don't. And second because you think I might make a mistake that results in injury. But why pick out cycling, I could slip walking. Should I wear protection for everything? A cycle helmet only protects the top of the head. What are the odds, first falling  second landing on top of my head? Shouldn't I protect the whole skull...it makes no sense not to given you think I need protecting. If I land feet first at speed the shock will transmit through my backbone and cause brain injury, a well known fact from people jumping great heights landing feet first. And what about the negatives. Wearing a helmet heats the head causing tiredness and lack of attention leading to accidents.  Finally where no motor vehicles are involved cycle injuries are so rare (for people using a bike to travel, not sport riders competing and putting themselves in dangerous situations...even then deaths are rare) there is no need to wear a helmet.  Please wear one if it makes you feel better but the quotes you give of safety improvements are a fiction.</span></div>","author":"Tom Jones","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_12688","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Elizabeth Wiczer\"> one other very interesting point Elizabeth is that the USA has the highest helmet take up yet the highest cyclist deaths per mile travelled. \n\"Netherlands reported both the lowest rates of helmet use and the lowest fatality rates.\"\nThis from the report I read.

Let me be clear, where no cars are involved cycling is a very safe option. In countries with good cycling road design, cycling is safe. In countries that have almost no cycling infrastructure the rise in cycling deaths is related to increased car use.
