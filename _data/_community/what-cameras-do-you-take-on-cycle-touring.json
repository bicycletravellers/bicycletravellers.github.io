I think he has a good combination of two cameras (plus the optional drone if you are so inclined).  The first is a GoPro, which he uses for pretty much all the on-the-bike shots.  However, he carries a second camera, in his case a Sony RX100 vii (which at least one other person has already recommended).  Ryan calls it his \"beauty camera\".  It will take much better pictures than the GoPro but also shoots very good 4K video and has a decent amount of zoom (GoPro has no optical zoom at all).  The downside of course is that the RX100 is a $1000+ camera but there are comparable cameras that are much, much cheaper with similar features that are also very small.  You are trying to find a compromise between small size, some amount of zoom (don't need too much), the ability to shoot 4K video, and ideally a fast lens (low f-stop number) for shooting good close-up shots of flowers and what not and a little better low-light.
