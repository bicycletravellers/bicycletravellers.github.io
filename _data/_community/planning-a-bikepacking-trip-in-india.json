But here's a few tips. \nDon't wear lycra. Cover yourself up a bit. \nBeware of men who approach you to offer you help. Be cautiously friendly rather than aggressively rude when dismissing them,  but don't just follow them blindly up any old alley. Try to stay humble always. People in india are often struggle for survival. They dont have welfare. Its usually money they want, not to rape you but you need to be cautious, especially being younger. Old people do get more respect. When you need help, you choose who to ask. \nRide on small roads, not big highways. \nThe guesthouses in remote small non-tourist towns can be pretty awful. Just be ready for that meanwhile. \nNever tell anyone how much your bike cost, or how much anything cost. If you do have to say something, keep the price low.\nYou will have to put up with a great deal of repetitve enquiries and greetings.

India is a beautiful large country with all possible kind of terrain and landscape you can imagine that keeps changing in every few hundred kilometers. There's a saying that goes 'one doesn't need to travel entire world if the person has seen every part of india'\nAs a full time tourer from India these would be my pieces of advice to start with. \n\n1. Research well and decide your region and exactly what you want out of the trip.  Dessert, forest, low hill, high altitude, coastal, cultural, landscape, rural everything you can find here depending upon your choices and tastes. (Route will come later into scenes. As in usual cases, you'd probably be modifying it many times on your journey.) \n\n2. Whichever region you are choosing, get an elaborate idea about different routes of it. You can use couchsurfing, warmshower, many reliable cycle and travel fb groups(not all of them) to find travelers from different region to help you on this. \nWhichever route you are taking, plan it well in terms of distance and elevation and most importantly road condition that a gps map can't capture. \n\n3. Plan your night stay well in advance depending upon your comfort level. Stelth camping is not the idea in India. Your options being... A.Make an online booking from a reliable website for the evening, B. Find a host C. Find a homestay or budget accommodation offline on the spot. E. Find a 'Gurudwara', Sikh place of worship, they consider it a virtue to give shelter to stranger  E. Self camping. If you choose the last option make sure you are doing it 1. In the light. 2. Choose your campsite before dark 3. Do it near some human settlement/private property/police station/gas station/family with women and children etc. 4. Use your 6th sense.\n\n4. To start bikepacking in India as a solo white female biker, start with the Himalayas or North-East India which resembles more with the South-East Asia. Women's safety is the last worry in these two part. Most of the South India is also completely safe for women traveller. \n\n5.AVOID OR DO NOT TRAVEL WITHOUT A PEPPER SPRAY IN NORTH, CENTRAL INDIA like HARYANA, U.P, PUNJAB, DELHI etc. If you are alone and don't know what you are doing.\n\n6. Keep you plans off the social media. Make sure it's not well advertised on the social media well in advance. You never know where the stalkers are.\n\n7. Don't listen to advices from people/male/non-travellers who haven't toured well in their life or in India. The world is not really as bad as it seems from home or from the media.\n\nThe list is not comprehensive,but as much as I can remember at the moment. It'd help to assist you if I know how much work you have done already. \n\nIf you need any sort of assistance or guidance regarding bicycle touring in anywhere of India, you are most welcome to leave a message. \n\nP.S: \nThese are some popular mountain circuit you can check out or combine to start from. Which are full of adventure and treacherous regions. \n1. Spiti tribal circuit. (Shimla - Kaza - Manali)\n2. Manali -Leh route. \n3.

If he won't go... I will definitely visit India at some other time. Why? \n\nThere was one comment \"If it's on your bucket list, then do it\". I must admit that I started looking into traveling to India based on the cheap flight tickets I saw a few days ago. But the truth is - my dream (for a long time) is to travel across the USA. I always postponed it because of a lack of financial resources and being a bit afraid of taking at least 2 months off work.

Now the actual cycling - as far as i know there are no cycling routes - like the way you find in uk either within the city or intercity. So you are basically sharing the road with all other vehicles and quite risky in my view. Might sound negative but i wouldnt do a cycling trip solo. Please book proper hotels for the stop overs. Pitching a tent somewhere secluded on the way - i wouldnt recommend. Possibly you are thinking what scared chicken - but i would put personal safety first.
