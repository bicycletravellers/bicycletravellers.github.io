Now, I go as light as possible with nice compact gearing on a titanium frame designed for gravel. Basically 2 kits, I wash one at night and wear the other one, my luxury item is a tablet loaded with books and movies. Cycling shoes with recessed clips so only one pair needed. Now it's an extended saddle bag, a frame bag and a handlebar bag. Love the relatively new bikepacking gear set up. No wide panniers that get in the way in tight spots, a lot less weight on the back wheel and more aerodynamic. I was zipping at 30km/hr+ on nice flat roads in Turkey(Black Sea Coast) and Vietnam's Highway 1.</div>","author":"Gilles Bonnier","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_643385","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Everything got lighter but then as gadgets became more of a thing, it got heavier. Sure, I got rid of the photocopied paper maps, but now I had a tablet, phone, wall chargers and cables, portable chargers, and eventually my MacBook air made its way into the backpack along with its cable and charger. I started with no GPS device, now I have one and the charger.\n\nI did cut back drastically on tent and camping stuff - I never use one anymore, just sleeping bag (if even that) and a light shelter or find an awning to sleep under. I don't carry food anymore because - at least where I tour - there is never anywhere that I can not stop to buy something to eat, and eating local specialties is part of the fun, so I don't want to carry a jar of peanut butter, instant noodles, a stove, etc.  \n\nI don't make coffee in the morning. If I can not find a vending machine with coffee, I just go without, so no need for the stove and extra water.\n\nClothing I take less than when I first did it, simply because I know more now that I only need one clean set for after bath, and my stinky riding clothes for when I am riding.\n\nSpare tires and repair kit and mini air pump are always with me.</div>","author":"Kevin Cameron","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
