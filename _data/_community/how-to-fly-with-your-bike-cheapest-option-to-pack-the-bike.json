Put pipe lagging over all the frame tubes and copious amounts of big bubble wrap. Did the usual deflating the trees, removing pedals and turning handle bars but EasyJet REFUSED to accept my bike at check in Luton. I was laughed at. Numerous of their staff came by to gawp and make snide and rude remarks about my packing despite m bike probably being more safe than in a box. I had printed out their bike packaging policy which states various ways of packing your bike including a bicycle bag but they weren't having any of it. They told me I needed a hard bike case like the Pro cyclists use. I told them I wasn't a Pro cyclist, yet and in any case their written policy did not state this. Then one their staff laughed at me. they then told me I needed to get my bike wrapped but their bike policy does not state this either. In any case I eventually found the wrapping place having struggled with my bike and luggage up and down what concourse at Luton several times. The wrapping place is only open in the mornings. It was 2:30pm. But they would have know this. It was humiliating and demeaning. They were taking the piss. I wasn't able to board my flight and missed it. Easy Jet are a shit airline. So I demanded to see their duty manager who eventually booked me on another flight from Gatwick 2 days later which was a real PITA to get to. The airline ground staff just made things up as they went along refusing to follow their written bike packing policy as given on their website and I had in my hand. One particular officious and nasty woman from EJ said \"I've been working here 13 years and never seen a bike packed like that and laughed\" \"Well you have now!\" I've flown with my bike packaged just like this quite a few times without incident, no damage whatsoever and with EJ! They were just b*****ds. So two days later I went down to Gatwick with my Brompton. No issues with this but it was total chaos there. My advice is never fly EJ with a bike as it was a nightmare. EJ refused to refund me all the expenses I incurred getting home and then back out to Gatwick two days later, refused to refund me the £90 I had paid to carry my full frame bike as the Brompton packaged up can passed as checked hold luggage. They claimed my Brompton weighed 31kgs, as if, and was over sized which it was not in a Dimpa bag and heavy duty BDH Brompton fabric bag. It weighed 18.3kgs with the external bags, tools etc inside. EJ are just w*****rs. If you take your bike in a clear heavy duty plastic bike bag like this they will refuse to allow you to even check in let alone board your flight despite it being fine according to their own bike carriage and packing policy. So now I have to sue EJ to try to get my money back. I also lost 3 days of my holiday and couldn't do the off road riding I had wanted to do on Gran Canaria with my full sized frame bike as although the Brompton is good it is not for off road trail riding. I had to radically change what I had planned and paid for. Lost two nights of hotel accommodation as well. I have flown lots long haul with my bikes in these plastic clear heavy duty bags with no problems whatsoever.</span></div>","author":"Alex Maudorn","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_751619","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Jeff Stone\"> Here’s my bike ready to fly with BA from Sydney to London.</span></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/how-to-fly-with-your-bike-cheapest-option-to-pack-the-bike/image_1655222977_3386706884.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Sam Reich","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_315102","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Alex Maudorn\"> the clerks at the United Desk in Amsterdam gave me the same line until I showed them their policy (which I printed out) they didn’t know that you could use a bag.
