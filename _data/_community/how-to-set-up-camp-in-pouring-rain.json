Then under the shelter if the (wet) fly pack everything into panniers and dress for the conditions(!) Then unclip the (wet) fly from the poles and pack these where they won't get the dry stuff wet.\nThere's usually a chance during the day to lay out the fly to dry.\nThe next time setting up the tent is a little different.
