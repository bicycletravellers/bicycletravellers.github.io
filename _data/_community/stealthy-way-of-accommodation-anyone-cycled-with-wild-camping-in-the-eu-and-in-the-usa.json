Apart from that, I've never been asked to move on, however, I do tend to wild camp in places where the chance of discovery is unlikely. Sometimes you have to bite the bullet and use what on the surface is a compromising spot. When that happens I sometimes ask locals or dog walkers if it's acceptable to camp and I stress it's only for one night. A green tent helps. I would add that if you are sensible and don't over-worry about it 99% of the time you'll be fine.

In some states yes (out of a forest) in others not but who cares? Don‚Äôt make a fire, take your waste with you and it should be o.k. Use a dark green or a camo tent which reduces the risk to get some visitors. Don‚Äôt do it in national parks and protected nature areas, in normal nature parks be careful to be away from places where rangers (very rare) are. Otherwise normal people will not border you and in the very rare case where someone gets angry (I have never heard about it) they may have to call the police and that may take so much time that you can make your way. In the worst case, at last out of official parks, you may get asked to go away. Fines are very rare but in theory possible. But if you are nice to them and friendly not likely that someone is doing it, tell them you don‚Äôt know where to go and‚Ä¶. You can also ask farmers to put your tent on the ground ‚Äì normally they are o.k. with this. There are a lot of ways. I like also those simple open huts which are a lot in the nature parks</div>",

You have to order such things early and improve the equipment with time. Aliexpress from China takes always to Germany in between 2 up to 6 weeks and in some rare cases 12 weeks. The DD Camo will be faster within Europe- you will also find something like this in green at Aliexpress even in Silicon-Nylon which is a better material in the long term which I have also but I like the camo. Ali has also very light carbon poles for the tent otherwise a walking stick will do the job. It's really good to hide the tent in the right environment (like in Europe) and light.</span></div>",

I might think of taking the random totally not lightweight tent otherwise okay-ish tent with us or try to look cheaper smaller a bit more lightweight... This time it s backpacking though, I think... Not sure but depends on how we manage... Not too much time to plan(fixed dates with family) but the good news, already started tryouts for both... The bike just tried a 7+7km trip from one side of town to the other. Was harder than thought!! And couldn't look at the bike for so many days üòÖ and second backpacking with a toddler partly in my hiking bag... Omg!! It s heavy! But mostly as I don't know how to fix the size of the bag to be well proportioned... If I'll do that. It seems like bikepacking, even with the   toddler on the back, is easier than bike backing, for now... For that, though I d need a well-working tent... With all the necessary parts... Imma check that first! Ps. I didn't mention, my idea is, however, to get from northeast to south, and spend some time around there...</span></div>",

For me the hardest place is the Netherlands, it seems like every inch is owned and not many hideaway places, I'm going to try at least one night wild there this year when I make my trip.

The other day someone said  \"and I stick a little flag in it for the local farmer\"   ...the shovel below is made of titanium, 35 grs. --------obviously ideal is to stop at a public WC like in gas stations before heading wild camping.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/stealthy-way-of-accommodation-anyone-cycled-with-wild-camping-in-the-eu-and-in-the-usa/image_1655187290.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>",

When found, before unpacking, first make a coffee, and chill. Just feel the place and see if someone is coming. Then unpack. Don't put my tarp on yet. Some cooking and eating. If someone comes, ask their opinion about you camping there. My experience is people who don't mind/are positive or point you to a better spot. \nIn my point of view, being stealthy/sneaky makes you suspicious...I just act as if I belong (which we do!), works for me...\n\nIntuition is important! follow yours...\nBe nice!, always...\nNever panic, and if you do...just stop, coffee, and think.\nNever take important decisions when in a panic!\nLeave no trace\n\nThe world is yours!, Own it</div>",

For example parks in city centres are excluded and private yards (but you can temporarily sleep on any privately owned land as long it is no one's backyard)...\n\nBut the hard part is that Finnish nature is swamps, rocks, and lots of trees, but more trees and a lot more trees. You better look beforehand for a good map to save time. A dry coniferous forest is the best. The good part is that there is no dark in summer so you can keep looking at the map all night. Often cyclists go late in the evening to a small beach and put there a tent, especially if they cycle out of the big cities. Not officially allowed but really there is no one to care. You will not get a fine for doing that.  We also have free primitive huts and some of those can be close to cycle routes.</div>",
