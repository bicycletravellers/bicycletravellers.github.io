For example parks in city centers excluded and the private yards (but you can temporarly sleep any privately owned land as long it is no ones backyard)...\n\nBut the hard part is that Finnish nature is swamps, rocks, lots of trees, bit more trees and lot more trees. You better look beforehand a good map to save time. Dry coniferous forest is the best. Good part is that there is no dark in summer so you can keep looking the map all night. Often cyclists go late in the evening to small beach and put there a tent, especially if you cycle out of the big cities. Not officially allowed but really there is no one to care. You will not get a fine for doing that.
