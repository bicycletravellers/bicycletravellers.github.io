Make sure your optician knows that and sets the lens center where you look out from, in my prescription it made a huge difference and was about 10mm above the normal center.   Lens perscription changes depending on where in teh curve you look as the lens is two different concave and convex surfaces and not a uniform lens thickness.  I even had Oakly make gold mirrored lenses with that compensation as I look ouot the top edge of my glasses when I ride.  Also \"wind\" test the frames  ride them before investing to insure you don't get breeze behind the lenses at speed, My regular prescriptions do that and my eyes constantly water with my normal glasses.</div>","author":"Rick Everett","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_558034","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Rick Everett\"> very informative 👊🏽</span></div>","author":"Waqaas Aziz","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_795469","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I've had Rad8 504s for around 6 years and 2 different prescriptions I find them really comfy and the transition from clear to dark really quick and effective</div>","author":"Gary Walls","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_965966","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Check the out Bose integrated bone induction headphones.
