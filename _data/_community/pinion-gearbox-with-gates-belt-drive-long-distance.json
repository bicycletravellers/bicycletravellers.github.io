They are, by far, the best investment I’ve made in 37+ years of riding. I have both a p1.18 and a c1.12. Honestly, I prefer the c1.12. In the rolling terrain that I ride, I find that the 18 requires too much shifting. The additional drag (if it actually exists in the real world) is inconsequential.

IMO it’s the perfect setup for touring/bikepacking. I have more gear range than I usually need. I do notice getting started from a stop takes a little more muscle than with standard drivetrain, but once I’m going, there is no difference or extra resistance. I don’t do any racing, but I think the extra initial resistance could be a hindrance there, depending on how competitive you are. \n\nIf you ride drop bars you have to get creative with the shifter. I tried all available options (Cinq, Co-motions, and stock pinion shifter) and landed with the stock shifter mounted to a simple accessory mount extender. If you run flat bars then no problem. \n\nThe shifting takes some getting used to because you cannot shift into an easier gear while pedaling at all. It’s a little more extreme than just backing off the pedals a bit like you do with a standard derailleur. This is a big turn off for a lot of people. It was tricky for me at first, but once I got used to it and got my timing down, I loved the ability to shift to any gear. Think of releasing pressure off the pedals like putting in the clutch of a car, you can then put it in any gear you want. You can also switch gears when you are stopped, which has been a convenience I didn’t realize I was missing. \n\nThe gearbox itself is pretty bombproof. Completely sealed and only requires annual oil changes, which are so easy. If you pair it with a gates belt drive you end up with a nearly maintenance free system. Occasionally I rinse off the belt with some water because it gets squeaky in dusty conditions, but that doesn’t affect the performance.</div>","author":"Megan Rose","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_291784","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I have a custom Co-Motion steel frame with the P1.18 and gates belt. As expected with a custom build, the fit is perfect and it rides really, really nice. Bit on the heavy side (32lbs unloaded).  Make sure you calculate what you want your end gear ratio to be. IIRC, The Pinion has a 0.55 internal granny gear, but you adjust that with the sizes of the sprockets on the outside. \n\nMine came with a 39T front and 34T in back, which was a bit harder than I wanted, so I switched the front to a 32T (had to replace the belt too) and now it feels good to me climbing.
