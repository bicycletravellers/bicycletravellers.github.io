I'm planning a pretty long trip all over my state (WA), but still need to get bags. I plan on going as minimal as possible.\n\n1. What is your opinion? Saddle bags with the rack, or the seat bag?\n\n2. Which tends to cost less?\n\n3. Any good recommendations for either?\n\nI do plan on doing my own research on prices and everything, just wanted to get opinions of those who have experienced one or the other.</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_694955","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_731703","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">A rack will take more capacity &amp; weight</div>","author":"Ashley Burton","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_957112","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Panniers (the “saddle bags”) have more volume for about the same cost as a seat bag (the bags that hand off the saddle).

If you are planning a trip that involves rugged off-road travel, a seat bag is a better choice because it attaches to the bike more strongly.\n\nBottom line:  if you plan a trip on rough roads and backcountry, bikepacking bags (you’ll need more than just the seat bag).

They are light and reasonable cheap ($50) - you can put a small roll on it or you can load it up.   Either way it won't flop around and will be cheaper than a seat bag.   I like the versatility.

I use the saddle bag for almost every ride as it also works as a mudguard and it is more aerodynamic than the panniers (since it is right behind you), allowing me to keep my spares and maybe some food for a 1 day ride.

If your carrying a bunch of stuff it's great.  It's also heavier and more difficult on single-track in the woods.  \n\nSeat bag is cheaper overall and great in minimalist trips.  Way lighter and a good one packed well can be great.  The drawback is you can't fully use your dropper and they can sway or sag if packed, attached, or designed poorly.  \n\nI personally like something like the swift industry Zeitgeist bag. It doesn't sway as much hold a decent amount but i still can use a droppwr effectively.\n <a href=\"https://builtbyswift.com/shop/zeitgeist-pack-dovetail-collection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://builtbyswift.com/shop/zeitgeist-pack-dovetail-collection/</a></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbuiltbyswift.com%2Fshop%2Fzeitgeist-pack-dovetail-collection%2F&amp;h=AT0urbySbptSNW69yyaZnBdUvR7AvbcHSpWw8ds9iAXF1z39TcovacaODSFFb8tNdBU_oWrlsDvZbft4KHDqoc7YG2de87TfUT7nXgLJGcDYmk66i_HjsPU1BG3CRZg_UgpirJKxveOdCvc&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://builtbyswift.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWIFT_6_216940-EditWEB_2048px.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Zeitgeist Pack, Dovetail Collection</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">builtbyswift.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"Alex Helling","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_606287","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Alex Helling\"> Love my Zeitgeist.

I prefer to have everything up higher but I've leaned to pack pretty light. Panniers, having stuff lower provides a bit of a sturdier ride. \n\nAlso keep in mind, you want to try and distribute weight evenly between front and back. You don't want heavy, loaded panniers in the back with nothing up front. Really depends on the kind of riding you're doing - mostly road riding, I'd get a pannier set up. Off road, I'd look at saddle/handlebar bags. Also, just google \"touring vs bikepacking\" - lots of info out there on this.</div>","author":"Rob Peters","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_621944","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I prefer using a rack &amp; panniers, &amp; I find them far easier to pack up each morning than a seat pack. Also easier to get something out during the day, as I put things I may need, like a rain jacket or lunch in the top of each pannier. For shorter, lightweight trips, I use smaller panniers. \nAll that said, I don’t do technical mountain bike trails, which others say panniers are not suitable for, but the panniers have been fine on rails to trails &amp; trails that are somewhat rougher than that (like some of the old, steep, I maintained logging roads near where I live).</div>","author":"Cheryl Leskiw","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_814568","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Thanks for all the answers and opinions! My trip involves off road, but its mainly rail trail until I get over the Cascades and into the metro area, after that a lot of it is either road or gravel. This trip (assuming I routed it correctly) is all rated for gravel, so I don't believe I'll be doing any serious off the smoother trail type riding. \n\nAt the moment it seems based on all of your experiences and recommendations that a rack and panniers (I thought that's what it was called, but I wasn't for sure!) are what I will go with. I don't plan on bring a lot, but maybe a little more than a seat bag would hold. I also plan on getting one of the smaller frame bags that only takes up the top half of the gap so I can carry extra water, and sleeping bag will probably go up front.\n\nThanks again, everyone!</div>","author":"Nicholas Johnson","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_217897","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Nicholas Johnson\"> great plan for how you're describing your ride.</span></div>","author":"Alex Helling","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_692411","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Rack will help keep your luggage weight lower.
