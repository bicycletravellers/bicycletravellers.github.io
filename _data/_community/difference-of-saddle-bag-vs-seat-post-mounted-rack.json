The load is cantilevered further out from the post so the leverage is more.  A bag puts a bit more stress on the saddle but the rails of the saddle are short.\n\nA seatpost mounted rack also encourages more volume and, thus, more weight and still more leverage on the seatpost.  If you need the volume of panniers, get a rack that mounts to the frame.
