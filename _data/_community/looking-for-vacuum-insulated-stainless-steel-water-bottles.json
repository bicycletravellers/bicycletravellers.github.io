I‚Äôve tried several other popular brands and I feel that hands down Yeti is the best. They‚Äôre backed by an amazing warranty, have various sizes, they‚Äôre by far the most durable and they use the best stainless steel. Many of the other brands look the same, but they‚Äôre inferior to Yeti. The others are more prone to denting or replacement parts aren‚Äôt easily obtained and even the other big brands like Hydro Flask use a lower quality stainless steel that actually develops rust spots. The Yeti stuff is even dishwasher safe so you can get it good and cleaned and sanitized. Yeti is the only brand that I buy.

The paint on ALL of them scratches off.\nYeti feels like it's built better, but I don't think it's worth the price for its functionality (my priorities). \nYou can buy a new Contigo twice a year for the cost of keeping a Yeti for 2 years.

Stainless steel is 25.  Aluminum is almost ten times more thermally conductive than stainless steel.  Furthermore as Eric points out, a vacuum insulation layer reduces the 25 to below 1 though it could get as low as 0.01,  with better caps or an aerogel layer.  So a vacuum insulated layer flask is hundreds of times better at insulating than an aluminum container.\n\nThe thermal (specific heat) capacity (in J/g ¬∞C) of aluminum is 0.89, while for stainless steel it is 0.5.  Aluminum has a density of 2.7 g/m¬≥ while stainless steel is 7.9 g/m¬≥.  This means aluminum holds twice as much heat as stainless steel by weight, but by volume the stainless steel holds 39% more heat.  Generally stainless steel can hold with less volume, with 505MPa vs 276 MPa for aluminum.  Thus for the same tensile strength of material, aluminum will still hold more heat.\n\nThus per their physical facts, none of what you wrote is true.\n\nAluminum both holds and absorbs heat more than an equally strong vessel in stainless steel, even if not vacuum insulated.  Adding vacuum insulation helps drastically more.</span></div>","author":"Seth Alan Woolley","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_395342","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Cheers Eric, they look like cracking bottles!
