In Europe, you rarely need to carry more than a dayâ€™s worth of food, as you are going through villages frequently (depending on the route). If you are doing a backcountry tour, you might have to carry multiple days of food. \nOne way to approach each dayâ€™s amount of food, is to decide how many calories you will need for the day. So, if you decide you need 3000 calories/day, then you plan your food accordingly. Itâ€™s always good to add emergency calories should things not work out, or you find you have underestimated your caloric needs.</div>","author":"Colleen Welch","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_597717","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Colleen Welch\"> \nHow do you convert between metric calories and imperial calories?</span></div>","author":"Justin M Short BA","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_412889","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">A lot of things can be had at the grocery store and arenâ€™t in cans.

Where / if you can re-stock. On my tours in the UK, there is always some town / village shop somewhere on route to re-stock. I like fresh food. Bacon can be carried at least a couple of days safely, Potatoes / onion / mushroom easily a week or more, Eggs are fine for ages but delicate, Canned food is heavy so carry less &amp; re-stock where possible. Rice / Pasta etc is always a good back-up but i so booooooring! (Cept when doing a Chinese curry (with Potato if you can't keep meat that long). I make up spice mixes for authentic British Indian Resturant (BIR) curries and also carry Mayflower Chinese Curry Sauce Powder. If I have not found a 'Re-stock' to get fresh meat, I will use a small potato, diced to simulate 'lumps' (it works - trust me).
