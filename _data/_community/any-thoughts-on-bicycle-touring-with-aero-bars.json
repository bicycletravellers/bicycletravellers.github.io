They give you an extra option for positioning, and do help relieve the wrists. But so does stopping and stretching. Useful against a strong headwind - I've noticed they give you a gears' worth of an advantage. Also, surprisingly, it's warmer on them because you block the wind with your shoulders rather than taking it in the torso.\nSo generally positive, but mostly if you're trying to go fast and/or non-stop. I just take a break when the wrists get tired.</div>","author":"Pavel Bogolyubov","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_527656","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Started using some this year. Using ones with 40mm spacers that raise them up by, we'll 40cm. This allows you to still put hands on tops of your handle bar and doesn't drop you too far into full aero position, which would be too uncomfortable. I use them on the longer flatter rides, really helps with an alternative position and gives your hands/wrists a rest.</div>","author":"Alan Fletcher","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_497875","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Touring Made Eaiser</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/any-thoughts-on-bicycle-touring-with-aero-bars/image_1655566044_5986658675.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Larry Gowar","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_429995","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">The main advantage is that you can take almost all your weight of the saddle and dance on the pedals allowing massive amounts of watt energy to be transferred into the pedals on both the push down and pull up</div>","author":"Robert Draycott","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_744931","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I bought some with the idea of doing this but they take up a lot of room on my (small sized) 'bars leaving me limited room foe my hands to ride on the tops... for luggage I've bought some bar risers instead .</div>","author":"Andrew Goodberry","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_340295","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Andrew Goodberry\"> most people ride on bars near brake hoods or on brake hoods so they can react to braking.</span></div>","author":"Mark Connelly","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_88723","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mark Connelly\"> me too but i find it good to have the option to change positions but will have to give the aeros another chance.</span></div>","author":"Andrew Goodberry","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_965755","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Another advantage is that it gives you extra space to store snacks, mount lights etc.</div>","author":"Steve Lindley","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_603058","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Sure.
