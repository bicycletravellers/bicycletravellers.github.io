I started with a goal of 15 miles a day on a 6 speed beach cruiser and added a trailer not long into my ride. I managed to keep between 15 and 35 miles a day until switching to an older mountain bike and losing the trailer (not by choice) and still only make 30-50 miles a day. Seeing others talk about 80-100 mile days had me questioning myself, until I rode 100 miles in a day and realized I didn’t see much of anything compared to my usual pace with lots of stops to take in the amazing views all around me. Now I’m quite happy with my riding, and the shorter distance for me translates to more appreciation of the landscape unfolding around me. \n\nHighways and especially interstates are usually good for riding (some states allow it, some don’t).
