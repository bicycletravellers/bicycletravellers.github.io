That being said, I did do a cross country trip on my motorcycle. The first time I took my phone and my wife's fancy Nikon DSLR camera. \nWhile the Nikon took excellent pictures as expected, I found it to be a real pain to fish it out of the bag, set it up, use it, and then stow it away again. Whereas if I used my phone I just had to grab it off my handlebars. \nWhen I took another motorcycle trip from ATL to AK I decided I'd just buy a new phone and only use it. It was much easier to use, and the quality of the photos is amazing. I've received numerous compliments on the pictures I took, and everyone has asked what kind of camera I used. The fact is, the quality of phone cameras now sometimes outperforms some of the cheaper DSLR's or hand-held's. \nAs a weight saving measure, I think the phone would be the optimal choice. Also, Quadlock sells accessories so you can attach a tripod mount onto the Quadlock phone case. With that you can use it to attach it to a small flexible tripod, or a larger sturdier one.\nUltimately, you have to decide what you're going to do with the pictures/video. Is it for you, and friends? Something you'll post on FB. Or are you looking to make a big video production for YouTube, or an article in National Geographic? If it's just for you and friends, I'd say go with a phone and a GoPro. If it's for a big to-do, go all out and get the DSLR. \nMost importantly though, have fun and enjoy your trip!</div>","author":"Kristopher Marshmallows","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_283574","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Kristopher Marshmallows\">spot on</span></div>","author":"Justin Serpico","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_25976","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">To be honest any modern smartphone will give adequate results.

Or do you plan to edit and print them? If it's the later than put a pin in it to 2) ease of use/storage/time to create. How much effort you want to put into image creation.\n\nIf creating content is not really your goal, you just want social media and memories, a cell phone and a gopro is what you need. If content creation and files you edit and print or view at high resolution is what you want then a bigger more serious camera like a compact or ILC is the correct camera. Cell phones are great for low res output but don't scale up well and don't edit well because the images are already highly processed unless you shoot raw and the raw files are honestly not amazing. \n\nThere are no right or wrong choices. Only what you are willing to carry and deal with. Any brand still producing cameras from Olympus to Sony to Fuji to Canon to Ricoh to Pentax can produce saleable images. If your bikepacking I'd likely opt for something with a M4/3 or APS-C format like Olympus or Fuji since, Imo, it hits the sweet spot of size/form factor and iq for bikepacking. For bike touring you could go with bigger systems like Canon, Pentax or Nikon or Sony. Advantages of Pentax, Fuji, and Olympus are their systems offer high levels of weather sealing on many models, including kit cameras/lenses.</div>","author":"Justin Serpico","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
