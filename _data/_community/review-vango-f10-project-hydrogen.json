Iâ€™ve been using mine for a little over a year and thought Iâ€™d share my thoughts.\n\nA little over 700g, packs down to the size of a water bottle, double-walled, surprisingly good living space and weather protection, no tent poles just an air beam. This means itâ€™s really compressible and easy to mount into bike bags.\n\nOverall, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™ve been very impressed but definitely strong pros and cons. Was a little dubious of the airbeam but as long as itâ€™s pumped enough it holds strong.\n\nThe massive PROS are the weight, size and living space. Itâ€™s lighter than a lot of bivvy/tarp combos and more practical than things like Tarptents which might require a tent pole.\n\nFor me, the CONS are the lightweight materials (Iâ€™ve not had issues but itâ€™s SO thin you have you to be careful) and also the pitching takes a bit of getting used to. Itâ€™s also expensive, at about Â£500.\n\nFor short-haul bikepacking/touring trips through 3 seasons, I think itâ€™s a pretty nice option. If it was a little cheaper, Iâ€™d say itâ€™s a VERY nice option!\n\nHappy to share any more feedback and Iâ€™ve also put together a video with my experience and tips for use, if you want any extra info: [https://youtu.be/XtgR5vTLHGI](https://youtu.be/XtgR5vTLHGI)\n\nHappy rides all :)<div class=\"post_attachment\"><div class=\"post_album_attachment\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/review-vango-f10-project-hydrogen/image_1655533473_7920964269.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/review-vango-f10-project-hydrogen/image_1655533473_3255324792.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/review-vango-f10-project-hydrogen/image_1655533474_1012920739.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/review-vango-f10-project-hydrogen/image_1655533474_7363405181.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img class=\"post_album_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/review-vango-f10-project-hydrogen/image_1655533475_6254184270.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div></i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_679302","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_748434","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Looks amazing.

I replaced it with the Hydrogen and it feels pretty much the same material-wise and is so far living up to the same standards, just a lot smaller and lighter. My only annoyance was the Airbeam. Initially, I was using a small Lezyne nano pump and after 45mins of pumping, it got nowhere! Did consider using CO2 inflaters but the waste involved, and the bulk of a cylinder each day, along with the possibility of the cold freezing the beam and destroying it was too great a worry to consider. I tried a track pump at home and that inflated the tent in no time, but that wasn't exactly packable. I've now changed over to a Frumpa Minipump (electric mini pump) and I'm getting over a week of tent inflations out of a charge on it and it has the tent up in 45secs now...far handier when you need shelter in a hurry trying to avoid bad weather.</div>","author":"Allan Rutland","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_512229","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Allan Rutland\"> a few people have mentioned this.
