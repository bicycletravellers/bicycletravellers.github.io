As others have said, ANY bike can be used. I notice that it has braze-ons for a front carrier.\n\nThere are four things worth saying:\n\n1 - depending on where you're going, you might want to have a lower gear on the freewheel/cassette for those mega-steep ascents. (Freewheels are probably better for touring: they can be removed easily with a simple tool and you don't need a chain whip. They are available in touring sizes of up to 34-12.)\n\n2 - the luggage you take will have a huge bearing on your experience. Take as little as possible and reduce the weight you're carrying to the absolute minimum.\n\n3 -  replace/service all the major bearings and have a wheel-builder check the wheels over. Replace the chain and brake blocks before you go and run them in for a few miles. Lube everything. Consider Slime for the tyres. Find the length of the spokes and carry 2 of each size + spare nipples. Repairing your bike is all part of the joy of touring ... but it's a bit more joyous when you don't need to.\n\n4 - think about visibility. I saw a touring biker the other day with bright yellow panniers ... and I saw the panniers first! I have a yellow backpack for cycling. It's big enough to carry a few essentials like snacks, sunglasses etc. and it's VERY visible.</div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"comment_photo_attachment\"><img class=\"comment_photo_image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/community/is-koga-miyata-suitable-for-bike-touring/image_1660134329_4746221767.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>","author":"Michael Papworth","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_492957","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Looks ok from this angle!
