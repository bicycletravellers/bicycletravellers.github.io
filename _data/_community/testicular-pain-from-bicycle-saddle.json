Also, some saddles have a sort of groove down the middle designed to take pressure off the sensitive areas. More upright combined with the seat placed pretty far back (paradoxically) works for me.

Sit bone width will tell you the proper saddle width for your physiology and flexibility will point you toward the proper saddle shape for your physiology... from there, a competent bike fitter will help you get the angle dialed in.
