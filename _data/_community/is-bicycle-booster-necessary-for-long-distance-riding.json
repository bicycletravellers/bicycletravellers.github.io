To answer your question then the simple answer is no, Bicycle Booster is not required.  The way to go far and over the bigger hills and passes is to get strong and the only way to do that is to get out there and pedal. Set off on your journey and you can get fit and strong on the trail. If you are limited for time and not going for a long time before you head out on your trip you will need to train or practice. There is no way round it. To get strong you must some how before or during you trip put the hours in.  Once you have that strength and endurance all becomes much more enjoyable even if, in the moment, those hills and distances remain challenging.  If as you start out you see bicycle booster as an option I think you are really missing the point about cycling, the joy comes in part from the effort. However, if you have some impediment that BB would help you overcome and allow you to actually get out there on a bicycle and experience the joy and the freedom then go for it.  Good luck, let us know how you proceed and how it works out, best wishes, S.</div>","author":"Simon Dodding","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_427034","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Simon Dodding\"> Gotcha, my father is trying to go bike around my hometown and I am concerned about his trip.

But you know him best, but what ever you do don't dent his confidence.  It would I believe be better for him to have a go and if need be fail and learn and then perhaps get the assistance you suggest, to propose it unsolicited would not be good.  The joy comes from just tackling the challenge, success is secondary.  But this is just my personal opinion, do what you think he would want and not what you think he needs, after all its all about him.  Best wishes, S.
