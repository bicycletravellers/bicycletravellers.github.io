A couple favorites that I prep in advance Split Red lentils, potato, carrot and onion all hold up well and mix with curry powder. Red lentils only require a short time to cook and mix in with the saut√©ed veggies for protein. It‚Äôs so much more flavorful than any dehydrated meal I‚Äôve had plus can be done in one pot. Saut√© all then add water to desired consistency and give lentils 5-10 minutes (note whole lentils require 15-20, split &lt; 10). \n\nPremix whole rolled oats (steel cut require too much time IMHO and instant are best used as wallpaper paste) and muesli with vanilla, cinnamon, pumpkin spice and sugar if you like. Can cook with just water, powder milk, or I carry a couple single serve milks that don‚Äôt need refrigerated til opened. You can bring to boil then let sit in pan while breaking camp and ready to eat. Much better than packaged. I usually add an apple to it and nuts if you don‚Äôt use muesli or know lunch is going to be a while.\n\nYes, it weighs a bit more but really not much as the only extra weight is the water in carrot, onion and potato plus 1-2 cup of milk or about 1 pound.</div>","author":"Jim Lee","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_998253","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Ramen and sardines.</div>","author":"Jack Kessler","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_416100","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">This guy will blow your mind! <a href=\"https://youtube.com/c/ChefCorso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtube.com/c/ChefCorso</a></div><div class=\"comment_attachment\"><div class=\"link-tool\"><a class=\"link-tool__content link-tool__content--rendered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fc%2FChefCorso&amp;h=AT1ZXm78V98o5kDt4y5iFKV5aiAO3O3kGZAFI460IQYH4hpz9_WeNtje9Omxyj9IUS4GOTqcx-32NzX0sLllOGRoOkUs7FEth-MiymLuPYoz4yHlL1UaXW9IryM6ieaZDp_gtBVxti67SbM&amp;s=1\"><div class=\"link-tool__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/O6-ygCbaRYuHXrdGAonANPXmP7lNfl5O5dcz_MUBHqB-nSYT3-azcv_mmNCCzwnQIieoaXPv=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"link-tool__title\">Chef Corso - YouTube</div><span class=\"link-tool__anchor truncate\">youtube.com</span></a></div></div>","author":"John Sandlin","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_656442","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Following</div>","author":"Mike Booth","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_99692","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I freeze steaks, veggies, scrambled eggs, milk, and other things.
