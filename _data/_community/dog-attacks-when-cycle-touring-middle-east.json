Other dogs are interested in chasing things or are curious about you. Remember, a small dog can cause just as bad a crash as a big dog.\n\nHow Dogs Chase and Attack Bikes\n\nA dog will sometimes give chase from the yard, dashing across an open space and entering the road. Other dogs will stand in the road and block passage. Some bark, but not all.\n\nDogs often attack from the rear, coming up from the side. A dog may wait for you to pass then give chase. You can sometimes use this to your advantage, a quick sprint might do the job of shaking the chasing dog.\n\nRoad Bike Rider Rules for Dogs That Chase Bikes\n\nDO NOT KICK ‚Äì Kicking at the dog while riding has been called ‚Äúsuicide on a bike‚Äù. You can easily fall or become tangled with the dog.\nConsider a sprint, but carefully! You might be able to out sprint the dog when he‚Äôs not determined or just intimidating you.  ‚ÄúYou can tell his intent by how hard he‚Äôs running and his expression. An easy gait with woofing and ears and tail up, no problem. A full-out sprint with ears back, tail down and teeth out, problem.‚Äù If you choose to sprint do so with caution. Erratic movements can lead to a crash.\nGuard your front wheel. ‚ÄúWhen a dog sees you coming, he might make a beeline for your bike, then attempt to turn up beside you. The danger here is that his poor little paws will skid on the pavement and he‚Äôll plow into your wheels. If he hits the front one, you‚Äôll crash.‚Äù  Sprinting can put you out front, move forward faster than he expects, and give him a margin for error by steering away if the road and traffic permit.\nSCREAM! Try NO, OFF, STAY, BACK, loud bold words may surprise the dog and cause him/her to hesitate for just the second you need to take the advantage. You can also try raising a hand or waving your arm like you are throwing something. Again the priority is to maintain your seat on the bike.\nSpray water- Take out your water bottle. Just holding it may serve as a deterrent. ‚ÄúIf he does come near you, give him a faceful and a loud yell.‚Äù Again, watch your riding. Don‚Äôt crash.\nHalt pepper spray- clip this to your  handlebar. Can be challenging to aim and affected by wind. Good to have around.\nGet off the bike- If other tactics are not working or seem dangerous get off the bike and put your bike between you and the dog. Swing the bike like a weapon if necessary, and start yelling for help.\n Call the cops. ‚ÄúIf you are attacked and bitten, report it to the county sheriff or other authority immediately. Include the location, a description of the dog and the owner‚Äôs name and address if you know them. Get medical attention without delay. If the dog was rabid, you are at risk of serious illness or even death. Demand proof of rabies vaccination or insist to authorities that the dog be quarantined.‚Äù\nKnowing in advance how to deal with dogs can help you reduce the chances of being bitten and crashing. A dog that just wants to give chase, but is not a real bite threat can still lead to a fatal crash. So think smart when you encounter a dog. Your life can depend on your actions.\n\nStay alert</div>","author":"Laurie Sams","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_525517","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Laurie Sams\"> One of the best adwices I`ve ever seen on a cyclist group üëè I`ve had, and been around, dogs for my entire live.

About dogs, yes, can be scary. I have learned to do the following things:\n1. Be the Alpha, the bigger dog. But assertive rather than aggressive.\n2. Point in the direction you want them to go - direct them away from you using arm motions and loud vocalizations.\n3. Outrun them, careful not to excite them by your feet spinning rapidly. This choice is determined by how close they are to you when you notice them.\n4. If necessary dismount keeping bike between you and them.\n5. Sometimes I speak to them as a mother to a baby (I've tried everything).\n6. Pick up, or pretend to pick up, a rock, or anything that could be perceived by them to be thrown at them. And then do so, either something real, or just something imaginary.\n7. At times I've resorted to buying a squirt bottle and putting lemon juice in it keeping it handy in case I need to spray their eyes. This is something I don't like to do, and I think I've only done it once or twice. Some areas are rougher than others and the dogs are not amenable to being easily scared away. I feel badly about it, but I would feel worse getting bitten in the leg in a far off country.\n\nFor the most part all my techniques have worked, and I've never been bitten, knock on wood!\n\nGood luck gaining the confidence to manage this daily hassle, and have a wonderful trip.

Once I was riding through central Minnesota south from Minneapolis, and suddenly a dog looking like a very large wolf came running flat out across the field towards me. I thought, \"I'm a gonner.\" But it turned out nobody was giving him attention at home and he just wanted to play. On the other hand I had a professor who was studying sheep herders in the Nepal Himalaya. One night he and a sheep herder wanted to visit another village so they set out. The sheep herder carried a large heavy pole which he would swing and set tumbling the mastiff sheep dogs that came at them from the darkness. That said, several sheep dogs that I met while trekking in Nepal, such as one we called Blackie and another we called Reddy (in Nepali) accompanied us, Reddy for several days before returning home. Of course I did not walk the high pastures at night when the dogs were on guard duty. Back in those innocent days, small children would also take up with us for several miles, engaging us with their curious and insightful thoughts. The author of the book \"Four Against Everest\" writing in 1962 spoke of how a small boy was sent 16 miles to fetch them after they'd come down from theor rather calamitous and illegal attempt to scale the north ridge of Mt.

One would have to restrain the animal and expose it to a reasonably large amount to cause damage. The amount of exposure from a quick spray is just very unpleasant, and the body's natural defences flush irritants very quickly. The nature of aggessive dog attacks is such that the open mouth gets the bulk of anything sprayed anyway. I should state also that one is not just randomly causing grief for any dog that wanders close, but only when truly under attack. This has only occurred rarely for me and always when trekking village to village in rural Latin America.

I didn't read them. Sorry if I repeat. I cycled from Germany down the balcans to the pamirs as well. If dogs came running I would stop. They usually then also stop. They love to run after who moves. Chasing isn't just fun but seems save tobthe dog. Someone who stops makes them not so cool out of the sudden. I also talk friendly to them. I believe a female voice filled with love does something but that's not an option for u or some I guess. I just love them so. In some countries locals throw rocks at them, so if one doesn't walk away and wants to keep coming when attempting to ride again, a bend over as if to grab a rock helps. I never worried, because they all stopped when I stopped. It feels wrong but look- everyone around walks and doesn't get barked at. The bike looks weird and it moves fast- I would bark and go for it too if it woke me up. üòÄStopping makes u look human and they are usually scary or good to dogs. \nI then rode with someone in Turkey and he squirted water at them, because he was sick of stopping. I saw that worked. Dogs get confused. I stuck to stopping. Also being 2 people didn't make it better. It is still a fast moving, funny object.
