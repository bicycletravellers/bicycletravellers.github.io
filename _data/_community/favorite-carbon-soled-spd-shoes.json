The entire sole is basically a bathtub that your foot goes in.  It completely encompasses your foot about 1/2‚Äù deep.  The Riot isn‚Äôt carbon fiber per say, but rather a composite of carbon and other materials, Vapor and other higher end models are true carbon fiber.  \n\nThe toe box is quite spacious if you get the correct size and the entire shoe is heat moldable.  I‚Äôm honestly not sure where the ‚Äúcarbon across the front of the toe box‚Äù comes from.  My toes don‚Äôt even touch the front of the toe box and the only thing above my toes is leather.  \n\nIf I had to come up with one complaint, If you do any technical riding that you would normally roll your foot a bit and get the bike side to side, it does feel a little less connected.  In that you don‚Äôt feel what the bike is doing under your feet as much.  This is why I still prefer the RX8 on the mountain bike.  \n\nNeither one of them are good for walking though.</span></div>","author":"Drew Downing","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_216877","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Drew Downing\"> thank you for that.
