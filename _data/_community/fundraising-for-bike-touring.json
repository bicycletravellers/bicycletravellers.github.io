My response is, \"it's for fun\".  Typically, the question continues, \"yes, but what are you raising money for?\". Hmm, do I have to raise money in order to be allowed to ride my bike, or can I just ride because I want to?\nThe second, again observed as both a participant and a volunteer, is that some of these people are not actually cyclists, they are 'people on bikes' (not a compliment).  These POB often lack knowledge, or at least execution, of cycling courtesies like signalling, calling out 'on your left' holding their line, riding single file in traffic and following traffic controls.  These POBs often make it riskier for the rest of us, either through erratic riding or irritating motorists.  Once, I volunteered at a local stop in a fundraising ride that seemed to have a lot of college kids participating (early September).  I was surprised when I would see a group ride in with identical carbon fiber bikes, then I realized they were rentals.  These guys, some big athletic linebacker looking guys, typically just dropped these $2000 bikes on the asphalt parking lot; got off and dropped it.  Not only was this inconsiderate of the next people to arrive, with these bikes scattered all over, but they had no respect for the bicycle itself.  This was tough to watch; were I riding, I would have not only inflated the tires, but I would have inspected the bike, cleaned it's chain, adjusted the derailleurs, cleaned the wheels and spokes with rubbing alcohol, polished the frame and maybe even wiped the tires with a damp cloth.  These guys just dropped 'em.  I wanted to cry.  \nIf you are going to do distance riding, you have to take care of and respect your partner, your bike.</div>","author":"Sondra Spencer","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_122020","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I'm of 2 camps&lt;  I would  myself never ask someone to fund my vacation\nBUT it seems there are many not like me  nd ask for $$:\nhey i see some riders been on the roads years, ( theres a south Korean girl in her 6 or 7th year) and part of the money they make on the road is thru people sponsoring them&lt;\ntough making a living blogging on the road\n\nif it floats ur boat , go for it\nif you dont want to give.....DON'T</div>","author":"Richard Reitman","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_532012","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I was wondering the same thing.</div>","author":"Rachel Karlsen","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_726909","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Sometimes I smell a scam.

In example, Tour De France started in order to increase sales for the newspaper L'Auto. Same with the Giro which was to increase sales and popularity of the La Gazetta dello Sport. In most cases people are doing a challenging route / event when asking for / collecting money i.e. ultra endurance events, everestings, 24h rides or in general rides or tours that are challenging in order to attract attention and as a result raise money for a certain cause. This is being implemented in other endurance sports such as running and swimming. I know it's banal but it is a way to get attention and raise some money for charity through the use of cycling. In my opinion when you're doing your regular ride (for me is between 100 - 120km with 2000- 2500m of elevation on a weekly basis) you can't turn it into a charity event. However, if I was going to do an everesting (8848m of elevation going up and down the same climb) I could've considered partnering with some kind of charitable foundation because everesting is challenging and can attract attention.</div>","author":"Christos Andreev","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_519411","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I would not even know how to ride a fundraiser.
