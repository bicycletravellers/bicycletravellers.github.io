It's not like a cable brake that needs occasional adjustment as the pads wear and the cable stretches. You will eventually have to reset the pistons when you replace pads which is very easy, and very occasionally bleed your brakes which isn't as hard as people think and not an expensive job for a bike shop. You shouldn't have to bleed brakes more than once a year. If using dot fluid (sram) you must flush your brake fluid once a year in addition to bleeding.
