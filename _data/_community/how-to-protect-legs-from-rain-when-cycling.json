In warm weather/climates it doesn't matter if you get wet.  But if where/when you are riding can get down to near freezing point, and pouring in a storm with wind, in a place where there is no quickly reached shelter, it is worth having waterproof trousers of some kind. Cheap lightweight ones will do this emergency type role fine, even if a bit leaky or not at all breathable. They don't have to keep you truly dry (none will in any case), or be super comfy to ride in.
