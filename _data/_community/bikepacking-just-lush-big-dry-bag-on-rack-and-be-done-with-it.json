The only point that is lacking with the zip is that the flap design is not so waterproof, even though ther rest of the bag is waterproof. The shoulder straps and hip belt are rucksack quality. \nThe roll top one is more waterproof, but is made of a more pvc type material. And the straps are basic webbing.It was much cheaper, but looks it.\n\nDesign might also be a consideration. The roll top one is basically two tubes. One tube for the body, and a second vertical tube for the neck., with is welded to the main body. This uses less material and is lighter, BUT the usable opening to the main body is restricted by this design. Not a problem if you are only bundling in soft stuff, but if you need to fit in equipment in a case (which I do) then it is a problem.</div>","author":"Mark Perry","gender":"UNKNOWN","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_811192","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Addendum.

I use a dry bag on top of my panniers during winter touring. Unless my panniers are stuffed firm, it has a STRONG tendency for the contents to compress and lean to one side or the other. The same is true when I put a dry bag on my front rack, stuffed firmly with my tent. I used to strap a backpack across my panniers as well and had the same problem.\n\nIF you install a massive, wide rear rack - it may avoid the issue. Or put a few metal struts inside the duffel bag. You'll still have a really high center of gravity which will lead to poor handling. Plus you have to take care (and minutes) fastening the straps so they don't get stuck in the wheels, or allow the bag to shift. And if the entire weight of the bag decides to shift, it may send you off the side of a hill or under the tires of a truck. But, as a guy who did his first tours on a folding bike with panniers and a loose backpack literally hanging from the handlebars, swinging back and forth -- you can learn to get used to poor handling. It's just far from desirable, and potentially dangerous unless done carefully. \n\nThings often become specialized for a reason. Certain panniers do their job really well. I'm happy with mine, which clip on or off in three seconds. It's much easier than trying to balance a large loose duffel. I'll never go back.</div>","author":"Tristan Natsirt","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_405500","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I use dry bags.
