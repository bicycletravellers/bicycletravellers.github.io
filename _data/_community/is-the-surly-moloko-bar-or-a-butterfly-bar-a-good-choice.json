I had one that was 780mm wide(very wide).  It seemed unstable when loaded (20 kg. (44 pounds)).  I have a Moloko bar and a Jones Loop bar.  I have settled on the jones because it felt more upright and more stable to me.  The Jones does lack a positiono to be forward into the wind. I think I can add some bar ends ont he front though.  I choose bars based on 1) control (safety), then only after I feel I can control a fully loaded bike, do I look for comfort.

It is much more comfortable, adds a lot of hand options, and my legs feel better after a ride.  Again, this is very short term use, but thus far, I'm sold.</div>","author":"Terry L.
