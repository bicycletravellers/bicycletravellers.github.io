We lived at and came from sea level but trained (hiking steep trails) for 6 months prior and think it helped immensely. I only had mild AMS once for a few hours at 14k and it passed with some aspirin. \nI did a lot of researcher beforehand, including lots of great info from this site, and listened to local guides as well as our own bodies. While we were in decent shape, once we hit 10k (flying in) we noticed we had to slow things down to avoid getting winded fast, so we did. We took 2 days beforehand to acclimatize based on the recommendations here and think that helped a lot. \nBut one of the things we also learned is that everyone is different. We since moved to 5,000‚Äô elevation and I find mountain biking over 8,000‚Äô is noticeable, so there are different levels.</span></div>","author":"Mark Courtenay","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_959479","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Mark Courtenay\"> Absolutely everyone is different.

Pulmonary action is the actual exchange of gases - primarily O2 and CO2 - while we are breathing.\n\nThis gas exchange isn't mechanical like respiration. Respiration uses our diaphragm muscle to pull air in and our ribcage muscles to push air out. Our pulmonary system is dependent mostly on atmospheric pressure. So, the lower air pressure at high altitudes mitigates the amount of O2 absorbed into our blood stream and the amount of CO2 dispersed out of it. Acclimation at altitude encourages an increase in blood cells to meet the O2 demand. Training masks cannot do that.</span></div>","author":"Aaron Crawford","gender":"MALE","level":"2"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_555138","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Stay hydrated</div>","author":"Johnny Wood","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_756604","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Smoking cigarettes seems to help.
