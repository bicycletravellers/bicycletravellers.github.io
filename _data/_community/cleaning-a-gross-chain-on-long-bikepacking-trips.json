Twigs and water will get the gunk off of jockey wheels and the cassette, but sometimes the chain is unhappy if you only add more lube. It's only happened a couple of times to me, and on trips mostly on pavement - I just gritted (hah!) my teeth until the end of the trip and cleaned things properly at home. On longer and/or dirtier trips it's not ideal. Worse, of course, with wet lube when you're expecting things other than pleasant sunshine.\n\nI've thought of using white gas I already had with me along with a toothbrush, and then rinsing with water. I haven't actually tried it - didn't have a second toothbrush, and would have been slightly worried about not rinsing the fuel out completely before relubing. Any other approaches when there aren't convenient bike shops along the way?</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_882363","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_294560","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Use less lube and just wipe it real clean. Chains only need lubricant on the inside of the roller bushings. Everything else is just superfluous and will attract grit, grime, and such causing more wear. \n\nLube your chain when it makes noise. I‚Äôve replaced thousands of drivetrains working in shops the vast majority of them are way over lubed. The ones that are under lubricated tend to last longer. Put lube on and let it set, then wipe off any excess. \n\nDon‚Äôt use any solvent like white gas. Chain manufacturers go to great lengths to get grease inside the bushings. Dissolving that grease is counter productive and wears it out faster.
