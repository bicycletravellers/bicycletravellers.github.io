It doesn't keep the front wheel planted when going over bumps. Bumps still cause the while bike to move. The stem just improves comfort at the hand contact point. That comfort might mean your *ability* to steer and control the bike is better. That comfort also means you can ride longer before your hands get tired.\n\nJust don't confuse that comfort with the type of improved handling gained from suspension on the wheel.
