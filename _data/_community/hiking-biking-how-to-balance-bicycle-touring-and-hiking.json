How do you balance the need for carrying capacity and ability to hike easily with the bike?\n\nI have two ideas in mind. One is to mount a backpack on the rear, which can be removed and put on your back for hiking sections. Could probably go up to 30 liters? I also like this idea for train and air travel. The other is to have two different setups for the tour, one bulkier and one lighter, and ship things around. This seems like it could be a logistical nightmare though.</i>"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"center"}}},{"id":"id_844799","type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"id":"id_33333","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">I have taken a few trips, where I rode with a 65 liter backpack strapped to the back of my bike with bungee cords.

It was not comfortable and it only took one pannier - really needed to be designed to take two, and more research into the balance of how a good trekkers pack works.  Perhaps they have improved over the past few years. I think there may be other brands that also make these now. As I am unlikely to be away from my bike for more than a day walk, I now just carry a superlight, nylon day/overnight pack that can fit in what I need for a day or two. When not in use, it fits on the back rack or in a pannier. On trains (mostly Europe, but also USA) I either leave the panniers on the bike , or take them into my carriage. For flights, I carry a large plastic bag that can take both back panniers - small stuff goes on the  flight as hand luggage - Ido have a philosophy of never travelling with more than I can handle by myslef so  only ever have back panniers, not front ones - can't manage to carry four at once.</div>","author":"Biff Frederikson","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_520574","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">You might like to  look at how people with Brompton and other small wheeled touring bikes, tour long distances with a back pack standing vertically on the back rack, secured under the seat post.</div>","author":"Biff Frederikson","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}}]}
