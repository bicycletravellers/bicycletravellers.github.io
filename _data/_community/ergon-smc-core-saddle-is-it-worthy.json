It is part of it but only one piece of a larger puzzle. you need a proper bike fit if you want to go long distances. A proper fit will tune saddle height, saddle fore/aft which greatly affect weight on hands, saddle tilt angle, saddle width, handle bar reach (stem length), handle bar height, hoods placement, cleat placement. Then you need to progressively train your body. Your technique also plays a role - poor posture and engaging the wrong muscles will cause discomfort so you need to learn how to pedal correctly  and there is more to it than turning the crank. Hybrid bikes are not a solution and will cause more issues. A road/touring/gravel bike is better suited for long distances. Invest in a professional bike fit.
