A bit better geometry for trail riding with its' 68HT angle with the same bits and pieces.  The Salsa rangefinder has a better drivetrain and slightly more suspension travel in the roughly the same price range. It is hard for any bike to do everything well so it is often helpful to share what you are wanting from a bike with your LBS.  Availability is going to be something to consider as well.  Keep your options open for a steel frame for durability and comfort on long rides.  Maybe take a look at the Surly Bridgeclub.   A bit more money and the geometry is not as aggressive for trail riding, but the frame is made for a lifetime of service and has plenty of rack connections for touring.   If your budget allows, the options expand greatly as price goes up.</div>","author":"Jarod Cassada","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_313458","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Many km?
