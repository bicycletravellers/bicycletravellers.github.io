The difference has faded with bikepacking using larger and larger bags that require some sort of rod for support (But, it can't be a rack!) and using small packs on cages on the forks (But, they aren't racks!), or even Tailfin's bikepacking rear rack.

You don‚Äôt have to have actually gone on a single overnight ride to be in the group.  It is expensive though to join.  All you have to do is go out and buy an expensive but cool looking mongrel bike (Road bike look, but with wider MTB esk tyres), buy lots of expensive bags that are super small but with rugged brand names and lots of for purpose gear including tents that have only half of what you really need but have a super low kg number on it and then (and this is the important step), lay out the gear in the shape of a perfect square and take a photo of it, take a photo of the said bike e with bags on it and then post your pics plus you intent to go bikepacking on Insta and your done!  You will be welcomed in to the group arms wide open.  You don‚Äôt even have to have actually gone anywhere over night!  If you want to be a higher status member, it is not about the trips that you have done (you can just talk about the ones your gunna do), you just need to ensure your fork and frames have lots of braze on points, has no suspension and is made of steel.  Oh, and grow a beard.  If you are forced to go overnight, you could always just stay in a hotel (this is accepted) or keep the nights done to one or two at the most.\n\nNow if you want to join the touring group, you are going to have to actually go on some decent tours in exotic locations or at least travelling across countries and prove yourself before you are welcomed in.  And if/when you are, don‚Äôt expect recognition from those outside of the group.  It is just not as Insta friendly and the gear manufactures don‚Äôt make money out of you as the panniers last 20years and you don‚Äôt need special over priced tents that you have to carry on your handlebars with your ultralight sleeping bag in a gear holder on you forks!</span></div>","author":"Aaron Davis","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_577556","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Richard Record\"> well who's Billy nomates then üòÇ</span></div>","author":"Tony Jackson","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_156048","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Richard Record\"> The proper term is 'cycling dysphoria' and the diagnostic criteria can be found in the DSM-5. üòâ</span></div>","author":"Thomas Arson","gender":"MALE","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_170671","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\"><span class=\"ce-fbcomment-quote\" data-quote=\"Richard Record\"> That's my mix!</span></div>","author":"Jeri Elam","gender":"NEUTER","level":"1"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_949931","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">That question has spawned a YouTube cottage industry.</div>","author":"Tim Duffy","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_161904","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Bikepacking = camping, gravel/trail, minimalist</div>","author":"Julie Rossall","gender":"FEMALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_986742","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Asphalt</div>","author":"Clay Pardue","gender":"MALE","level":"0"},"tunes":{"AlignmentBlockTune":{"alignment":"left"}}},{"id":"id_134401","type":"fbcomment","data":{"text":"<div class=\"comment_text\">Easy.

Similarly you are going to pick a suitable bike for the terrain you think you are most likely to be cycling on. Bike packing isn't new - people have been travelling about by bicycle since bicycles were invented. I would argue that one of the early bikepackers of note was probably Thomas Stevens who went round the world on his penny farthing and packed his handlebar bag with socks, a spare shirt, a raincoat that doubled as tent and bedroll, and a pocket revolver. A bikepacking kit list to be proud of. But was he a really a bike packer? Would he have taken panniers containing some clean underwear and maybe a bar of soap had they been available to him and was he limited just by what he could get in that handlebar bag? He probably mostly ravelled on roads but I suspect they were not that great so was he a cycle tourer or a bike packer and does it matter? My argument is that providing you are having fun it doesn't really matter what you call it.

Touring bikes tend to be more robust to enable greater load management (panniers), whereas bikepacking bikes can be more lightweight to enable speedier and faster travels. \n\nBoth bikes can swap roles, yet my cross/gravel bike at 8kg with bikepacking bags will be lot faster on and off road, than my 13kg tour bike. While my cross bike can't handle panniers as well as the flexible aluminium frame isn't happy with the load.\n\nAs to semantics. I don't believe I want to survive a Scottish summer with bikepacking equipment - too many bugs (midges) and it'll be difficult carrying a tent. Similarly a winter as I can't carry enough warmth. Also getting truely off-road mean carrying food &amp; water, and that becomes difficult. Maybe I like my comforts...
