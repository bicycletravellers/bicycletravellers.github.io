title: "Bikepacking: Just Lash a Big Dry Bag on the Rack and be Done with It."
description: "Has anyone just lashed a big dry bag across their rear rack and been done with it? They make them up to 85L with backpack straps and I could just remove the whole thing at one time to take into the t.. Things have a tendency to compress... I use a dry bag on top of my panniers during winter touring. Unless my panniers are stuffed firm, it has a STRONG tendency for the contents to compress and lean to one side or the other. "
