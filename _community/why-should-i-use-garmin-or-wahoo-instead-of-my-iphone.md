title: "Why Should I Use Garmin or Wahoo Instead of my iPhone?"
description: "Battery life has been the biggest reason I stopped navigating with iPhone. And charging the phone is problematic in the rain. Also the touch screen is hard to operate in the rain and kind of goes berserk.  I have used a Garmin product for the past 15 years. Designed for the bike. I tend to store the phone in the off position."
