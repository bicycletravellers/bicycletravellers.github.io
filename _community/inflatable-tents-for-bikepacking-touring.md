title: "Inflatable Tents for Bikepacking/Touring?"
description: "Does anybody have any experience with inflatable tents? I'm looking at the Alpkit aeronaut in particular. I was going to get one. And wasn’t impressed with the reviews on their website. Shame a I have a lot of Alpkit stuff. I’ve gone for the Vango Cairngorms instead. "
