title: "Shorter Stem and Twitchy Steering"
description: "Changed to a shorter stem for a more comfortable, more upright position. This was marginally effective. However, the handlebars were more twitchy. After a few rides, got that under control. Put on rack and empty panniers and the twitchyness was back."
