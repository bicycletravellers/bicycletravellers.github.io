title: "Best Bike Chain Lube for Hot and Wet Weather"
description: " What's the best Chain Lube you've found for bike tours in wet and hot weather? (Long-lasting stuff)  Olive oil. Hot chain wax.  I’ve changed to Silca Synergetic, best lube I’ve ever used. Expensive but you don’t need to put much on, it is wet lube but used correctly the chain stays remarkably clean acting more like a dry lube."
