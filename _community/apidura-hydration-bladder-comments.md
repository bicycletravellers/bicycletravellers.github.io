title: "Apidura Hydration Bladder Comments"
description: "Really love this bladder. Have been using it daily for 6+ months now. excellent. For more water volume, I don't don't roll the top. I have that Apidira bladder, am currently using it on the wolf’s lair route in Italy. It’s worked great so far in my Oveja Negra frame bag, very happy with it."
