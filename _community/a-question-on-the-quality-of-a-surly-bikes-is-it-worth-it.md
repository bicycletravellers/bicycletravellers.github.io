title: "Quality of Surly Bikes: Is It Worth It?"
description: "I'm looking into buying a Surly as a 2nd bike (1st is  gravel). I'd like to be able to take it on rocky, muddy and sandy terrain, while still being decent on tar. But the real consideration is that the parts be durable and repairable for crossing Africa."
