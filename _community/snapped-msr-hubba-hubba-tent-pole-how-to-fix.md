title: "Snapped MSR Hubba Hubba Tent Pole: How to Fix"
description: "Snapped MSR Hubba Hubba pole. At a bit of a loss to know what to do with this and can't really continue until it's fixed. Because it's snapped at the end, I don't think putting a thin metal sleeve will do the job. I saw there were kits to repair this. Basically, two halves of a splint that goes over the cracked parts. Maybe that's something you can mcguyver in the field. Maybe a scrap of another discarded pole and duct tape, telephone handset cord or something."
