title: "Stylish, Comfortable, and Quality Helmets with Sun Visor"
description: "I haven’t worn a helmet in years.  What’s a quality and comfortable and stylish helmet. preferably with a sun visor.  If I may make a suggestion: look for a helmet with the MIPS system, it's proven to work, and due to the MIPS system itself, there is more space between your head and the styrofoam in the helmet, which helps air flow. My MET roam mips helmet saved my skull during a mountainbike accident in 2020 that was hard enough to break my face in 6 different places and knock most of my front teeth out."
