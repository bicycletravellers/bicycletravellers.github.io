title: "Crank Arm Length of a Touring Bike"
description: "Trek 520, my first touring bike, has cranks of 175. The 520 frame is size 54 and my roadie is 52. Having only done a few rides of moderate length so far, the 520 feels great. I'm just wondering if I'm possibly setting myself up for potential knee injuries from the longer cranks."
