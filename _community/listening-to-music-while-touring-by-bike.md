title: "Listening to Music while Touring by Bike"
description: " I now own Bluetooth in-ear phones, bone conduction phones, and a Bluetooth speaker. All of which I have used on the bike. In-ear phones, are not advisable for riding.  Bone induction phones... These do not have a good dynamic range, the bass is especially weak. But for general listening they are ok. They are easily audible at low volumes."
