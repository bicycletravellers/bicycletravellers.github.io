title: "Left Pedal Crank Falling off the Bicycle"
description: "I have seen cranks broken before they come off. The two left crank arm mounting bolts should be tightened alternately and incrementally rather than each bolt being fully tightened all at once. Tighten the two bolts holding the crank on a bit more.... whats happening here is insufficient torqueing, in fear of violating specifications."
