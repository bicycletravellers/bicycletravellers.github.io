title: "Planning Bicycle Trips is Not Easy!"
description: "I want to share my thoughts on planning bicycle trips. The problem with planning I think that planning the route with too many details is a waste of time. Things are always changing. Itâ€™s reassuring to plan the first day or two in a new country in some detail including a plan B or two bit after that I prefer a sketch idea of objectives be that places to visit, circumnavigation or days at the beach.
