title: "Should I Carry Spare Spokes when Bikepacking?"
description: "Do you carry spare spokes when bikepacking? I have DT Swiss G1800 wheels and just watched an how-to-replace video. not 100% sure I'd be able to replace a spoke with all the tools. I know people use a small piece of foam shoved into their seat post and put the spokes in there to keep them in place. A quick google for “spokes in seatpost” gave me this image to illustrate my point."
