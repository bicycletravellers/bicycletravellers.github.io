title: "How to Keep Valuables Safe when Bike Touring?"
description: "Where do you carry your passport, cards, cash etc. when traveling by touring bike? On the bike, on your person, in a travel wallet, a belt, or what? Neck wallet, but INSIDE your clothing. Mine never comes off my neck unless I'm in the shower, when it's inside the cubicle with me. If in a sleeping bag, it's in the bottom of the bag, where my feet are."
