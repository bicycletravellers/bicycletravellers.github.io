title: "Semantics: What Is the Difference between Bikepacking and Bike Touring?"
description: " Probably arguing semantics but; what in your opinion is the difference between bike-packing and touring?  Bikepacking is off road. Touring is on paved roads. You bikepack the GDMBR. In my opinion bikepacking is more remote travel with more of a ultralight setup, where touring is more a vacation but your travel mode is a bike."
