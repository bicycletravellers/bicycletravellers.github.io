title: "Is It Safe to Bicycle Tour as a Single Woman?"
description: "My question is more for single women… do you tour on your own?  I solo bike toured Europe for 6 months, 10,000 km. Camped at campgrounds when I could…true to camp next to families or other campers. When campgrounds not available there’s always a church, cemetery, corn field or nice home willing to take you in."
