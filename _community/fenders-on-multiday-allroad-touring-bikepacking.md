title: "Fenders on Multi-Day All-Road Touring/Bikepacking?"
description: "I recently read that fenders can actually make a wheel more aerodynamic (particularly a front wheel) and in fact provide you with a very small advantage; particularly since fenders can be quite light. Maybe thatâ€™s food for thought. In terms of touring, there is also no doubt that the protection they provide from the wet weather is second to none - reducing your gear or yourself continually getting dirt and water all over you."
