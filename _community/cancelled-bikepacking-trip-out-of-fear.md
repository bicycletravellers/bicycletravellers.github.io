title: "Cancelled My Bikepacking Trip Out of Fear"
description: "I tried bikepacking for the first time (solo), loaded up, weather looked great spirits were high, and I was about 15 miles from my campsite when suddenly the weather took a turn for the worse. It was pouring rain, whipping wind, with a bad thunderstorm directly overhead. A couple trees came down across the trail I was on, at times gusts almost knocked me over, and despite all my rain gear my shoes and socks became a puddle."
