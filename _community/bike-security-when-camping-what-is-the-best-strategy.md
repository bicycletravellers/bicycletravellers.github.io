title: "Bike Security when Camping: What Is the Best Strategy?"
description: "What are people doing  for overnight bike security when camping?  Got the Vodafone light/bike alarm. Amazing bit of kit, even sends distress message if you fall off. I use the Hiplock zip ties and put one through each wheel and around the frame then I use a strap off my seatpack and clip that round the bike and a tent peg. "
