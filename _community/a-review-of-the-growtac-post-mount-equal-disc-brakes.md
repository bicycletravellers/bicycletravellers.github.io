title: "A Review of the Growtac Post Mount Equal Disc Brakes"
description: "Some asked about Growtac Post Mount Equal Disc Brakes when I posted pics of the new bike. They work incredibly well. The brakes come with everything you need. I have mine set up using the compressionless cables. I am not a small roadie type. I'm 6-05 and weigh about 350 lbs. That means it takes a lot of work to stop this mass of ass when bombing down hill, and these brakes do just that."
