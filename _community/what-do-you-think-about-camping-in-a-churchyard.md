title: "What Do You Think About Camping in a Churchyard?"
description: " What's the thoughts on camping in churchyards? Mown lawns, quiet neighbours, usually water, and if weather is bad then the church porch can offer shelter.  I think the advice here Andrew, is it’s not recommended practice and perhaps a bit disrespectful. I suggest everybody else just calms down a bit and takes it for what it is. Don’t set up camp in a cemetery."
