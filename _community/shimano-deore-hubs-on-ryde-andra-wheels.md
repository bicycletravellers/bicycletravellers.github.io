title: "Shimano Deore Hubs on Ryde Andra Wheels"
description: "I'm looking for a good pair of wheels for touring. After some research I think Ryde andra 30 26\" 36H are the best rims for me and now I have a question about the hubs. I found these hubs Shimano Deore. Do you use any of these hubs or ryde andra rim or can you help me with any advice?"
