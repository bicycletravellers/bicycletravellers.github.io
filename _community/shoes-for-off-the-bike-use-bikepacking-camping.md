title: "Shoes for Off-The-Bike use when Bikepacking/Camping?"
description: " Hi I'm looking for recommendations for easy to pack footwear that I can use in the evenings on a mountain bike backing trip. This would be for walking to the pub etc.  I’m tempted by the barefoot shoes. On a cold wet evening in Aviemore I’d rather not be wearing sandals"
