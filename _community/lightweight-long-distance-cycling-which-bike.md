title: "Lightweight Long Distance Cycling: Which Bike?"
description: "Wanting to get into long distance cycling without all the luggage. What bike would you recommend a road or gravel.?  I short listed Trek 520. Kona Rove. Maybe a 700c wheeled touring bike. You don't need to put racks on it and you can still use bikepacking bags if you want. If you did want to put racks on it, and touring bags, you have that option in the future."
