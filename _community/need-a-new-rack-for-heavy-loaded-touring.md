title: "Need a New Rack for Heavy Loaded Bike Touring"
description: "Now, racks. I've been using a no-name Alu tubing one, of a conventional if a little old-school design. It served me well, but it's about 15 years old, and is getting on a bit. Got a new bike, so I'm looking for a sturdy bicycle rack for heavy loaded touring."
