title: "Cyclist's Palsy on Long-Distance Bike Tours"
description: "Anyone here deal with cyclist’s palsy? My hands went numb on day 2 and I’m trying to decide if I need to quit in order for them to improve.  I installed a handlebar extension . Raised it about 3 inches. Get padded gloves to start, but really put less weight on your palms for shorter time frames."
