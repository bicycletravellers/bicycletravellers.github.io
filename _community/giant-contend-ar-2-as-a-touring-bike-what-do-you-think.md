title: "Giant Contend AR 2 as a Touring Bike: What Do You Think?"
description: "Giant contend AR 2 as a touring bike? Thoughts? New to touring.   I like the geometry of these. I've toured on my defy, had 28 tyres too but that was the max. No rack mounts, so you'll need to fix  the rack to the seat post. Otherwise why not."
