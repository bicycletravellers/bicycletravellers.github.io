title: "Is Bike Touring on an Electric Bike Possible?"
description: "Has anyone done long distance bicycle touring on an electric bike? Pro's and Con's to it? I have done a number of long distance solo tours on ebikes. Did 17,800 km half a lap round Australia. Took 3 500wh batteries each and a large solar panel to make sure we could travel the 300 km between power points. "
