title: "Are Bears a Problem in Grand Tetons, Yellowstone and Glacier National Park?"
description: " Can i  talk Bears? In the UK we don't have to worry about wildlife so feeling nervous as we get nearer to Bear country, heading towards Grand Tetons Yellowstone etc. Well we camped, hiked and cycled through the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. Saw grizzles, elk, Bison and Moose. All awesome. The moose were the scariest! "
