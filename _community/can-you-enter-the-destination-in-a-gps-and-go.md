title: "Can You Enter the Destination in a GPS and Go?"
description: "Can you enter the location you’re wanting to travel to directly in to a bike GPS, like you can with your phone map? I’m super interested in one of the Garmin’s or a Wahoo, etc, but I’m not familiar with downloading maps and all of that. I’d love something where I can just easily enter the destination and Go.  "
