title: "Which Handlebar Satellite Navigation Device for Bike Touring?"
description: "I have used the GAIA GPS app to ride and hike on five continents and I highly recommend it. All smart phones have a GPS chip on them and you donâ€™t need a mobile phone (cellular) connection to use your phone as a GPS when using an app such as GAIA, Komoot etc. You can down load maps and plan your routes when on-line and then go onto Airplane mode when navigating and recording your route.
