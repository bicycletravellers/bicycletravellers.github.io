title: "I'm Thinking About Getting an Extrawheel Trailer"
description: " A new trailer I'm thinking on getting is extrawheel. You could consider a BOB yak or burley trailer with one wheel. Those have none of the issues mentioned regarding the extra wheel . I have a Aevon Kit L80 trailer. You can pull more than you can carry on the bike for the same effort."
