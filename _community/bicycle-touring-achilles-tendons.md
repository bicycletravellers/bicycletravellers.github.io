title: "Bicycle Touring and Achilles Tendon"
description: "I did a spontaneous 110km yesterday. I have very tender Achilles’ tendons (Achilles Tendinitis) this morning. I’m 41yo and relatively new to cycling. Saddle height, foot position. Using flats is an advantage as you can move your feet around a bit. It might be just the fact you've overdone it a bit if you are fairly new to cycling and extending distances."
