title: "Alpkit Soloist XL: Should I Buy It?"
description: "Alpkit Soloist XL: yay or nay?! Feel free to propose similarly priced freestanding alternatives for tall person  I’ve just used mine in anger for the first time. Very happy with it. I bought the XL for a bit more space , not because I’m tall . It’s been used a few times and has been fine. "
