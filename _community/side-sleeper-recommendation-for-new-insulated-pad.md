title: "I'm a Side Sleeper, I Need a New Insulated Pad for a Better Sleeping Comfort"
description: "Hey! Anyone a side sleeper? Post-winter prepping reminded me to replace my sleeping pad, with one that can better handle my sleeping on my side and the aging body that is needing more comfort as the years go by. I am a side sleeper as well. I use a Nemo Vector insulated pad. Wide. Hsve used it on 3 tours. Nemo makes a good product"
