title: "Bicycle Touring at High Altitudes and Preventing Altitude Sickness?"
description: "any tips on how to train for biking at higher altitudes, to prevent altitude sickness? We are planning a trip to Nepal and they warn for altitude sickness.  Do you have time to spend a day acclimating when you get there before you start riding? Most healthy people adapt fairly well up to a certain altitude. Definitely give yourself time to acclimate and always bike high, sleep low!"
