title: "Flat Bars or Drop Bars on a Gravel Bike?"
description: "Flat bars or drop bars for a gravel bike?  I now ride exclusively flat bars. If you want to know why I like flat bars over drop bars for gravel riding I'd be happy to share. My gravel routes have a lot of singletrack and off-road so flat bar for me atm is better."
