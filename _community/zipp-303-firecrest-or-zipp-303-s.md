title: "ZIPP 303 Firecrest or ZIPP 303S?"
description: "Would you spend the extra $600 and get the 303 Firecrest over the 303 S?  what rims? Just because they are the same depth doesn’t mean they are the same. Actual rim shape is equally as important as it’s depth.  November all Road 35s. They were listed as 38s, so may not be exact same profile now, but close."
