title: "Which Saddles are Comfortable for Long Days / Multi Day Bike Touring"
description: "Your recommendations for saddles which are comfortable for long days/multiple day trips. I have the standard saddle my bike was issued with and it's starting to not be comfortable enough. Another vote for Brooks. I like the Swallow and slightly prefer the titanium to the steel. I am pretty sure I have wider than average sit bones."
