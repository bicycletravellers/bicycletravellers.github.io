title: "How Long Does Chain/Sprocket Last when Bike Touring?"
description: "How long does your chain/sprocket last? I've run through my last set within 2000km/2months and I find that bit devastating. I would have assumed I keep the parts quite clean.. 1) You can check chain ring wear visually by looking at the teeth. If they look like shark fins, replace. I look at mine every time I clean my chain. "
