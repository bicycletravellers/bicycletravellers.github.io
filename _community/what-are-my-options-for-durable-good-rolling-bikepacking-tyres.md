title: "What are My Options for Durable, Good-Rolling Bikepacking Tyres?"
description: "I have just learnt that the schwalbe G-one allround offers 0 puncture protection. To me that is what schwalbe stands for. I can't go tubeless either. So, what are my options if I would like to buy durable, good rolling bikepacking tyres (700Ã—40c) that are not super heavy and offer punture protection (something that could live up to what the G-one allround offers)"
