title: "Light Color Long Sleeve Jerseys for Hot Weather BikePacking"
description: "Iâ€™m looking for a light color (to reflect heat) long sleeve jersey (sun protection) for gravel/bikepacking in hot weather.  I love the Columbia PFG long sleeve fly fishing shirts Brandi noted. SPF 50, breezy, dry quickly, can roll sleeves up, has pockets up front, and often have prints that hide the dirt well."
