title: "Which Shoes and Pedals for Cycle Touring"
description: "Recommendations for shoes and pedals, please.  I love my 510 Kestrels matched to my Shimano M-324 SPD pedals. What’s your preference? Flats or clips? Shimano PD EH500 (combo pedals - flat and clipped) are awesome! If I could pick my new shoes, they’d be Fizik Terra Atlas. Shimano SPD pedals and shoes Shimano MTB and Specialized Recon 3s have been great for me! "
