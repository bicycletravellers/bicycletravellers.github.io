title: "Pinion Gearbox with Gates Belt Drive for Long-Distance Bike Touring?"
description: "I run a 12 speed pinion. IMO it’s the perfect setup for touring/bikepacking. I have more gear range than I usually need. I do notice getting started from a stop takes a little more muscle than with standard drivetrain, but once I’m going, there is no difference or extra resistance."
