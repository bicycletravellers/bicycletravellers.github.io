title: "Advice on Biking Through Grizzly Country"
description: "I'm an experienced bike traveler, but I've never ridden in grizzly country.  This July, I will be following the Lewis and Clark trail W>E starting at the coast. Carry bear spray and, remember, all bears would rather avoid human interaction. The only time Iâ€™ve experienced a bear on-trail while riding was right at dusk- when they tend to be arousing from naps and starting to forage."
