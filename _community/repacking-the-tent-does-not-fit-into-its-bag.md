title: "Repacking the Tent? Tent Does Not Fit Back Into Its Bag"
description: "the tent, which seemed so compact and manageable when I brought it home, doesn’t even come close to being able to fit back into its carry bag after just one use. Is this typical, or is there a trick I should know? There’s no way this thing is fitting on my rear rack anymore! "
