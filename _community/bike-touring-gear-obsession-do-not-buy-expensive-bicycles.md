title: "Bike Touring Gear Obsession: Don't Buy Expensive Bicycles"
description: "Environment consciousness/fitness has pushed us towards cycling before cycling became fad. cost of a good bicycle was $50 in my country. Now co's like trek, giant, specialist, kona etc entered and made cycles cost as much as a 3 year used car. The peer pressure is so high in cycling groups to buy only branded cycles, if not you will feel left out. Isn't it time customers should decide not to give in to marketing and not buy expensive bicycles?"
