title: "Bad Knee Pain when Cycle Touring"
description: "Anyone experience knee pain while riding? I had bad knee pain so rested for nearly 2 weeks my knee felt better, today is my first day back on the bike and its already hurting again. I've done over 2000 miles on my bike prior to starting my tour so I know its not my bike or the way I ride it."
