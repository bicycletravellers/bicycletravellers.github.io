title: "Mold In Sleeping Pad"
description: "I bought a new Therm-a-rest last year and only used it for 2 tours. In February I slept on it for a week and then packed it away with my other outdoor gear. Easy. Spray with concrobium (available at hardware store). Let it sit for several minutes. Wipe to like-new cleanness. You can make a similar mold killer with oxy-clean."
