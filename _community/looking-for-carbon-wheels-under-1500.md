title: "Looking for Carbon Wheels Under $1500"
description: "Looking to upgrade to carbon wheels. Preferable under $1500 (US). Do they really make a difference? Bontrager makes a set for $1k and they come with lifetime warranty, so you can literally run them over with a car and Trek will replace them for free."
