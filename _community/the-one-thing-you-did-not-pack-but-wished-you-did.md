title: "The One Thing You Did Not Pack, but Really Wished You Did on Your Last Bike Touring Trip?"
description: "On your last trip, what was the one thing you didnâ€™t pack, but really wished you did? A small folding chair like the Helinox or similar. We used to have sit pads, but lost them somewhere along the way and there were times sat around a fire in the cold dirt that things would have been a lot nicer with something to sit on."
