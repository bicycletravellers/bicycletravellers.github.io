title: "Bikase VS Arundel: Any Experience with these Adjustable Bottle Cages?"
description: "Arundel VS Bikase adjustable cages. Does anyone have experience with both of these?I have a couple of Bikase (left pic), they work ok but my only gripe is that the plastic ratcheting system tends to  strip (teeth break) especially if exposed to mud and such, and the wheel gets off center as a result. I don't have any experience with the Arundel."
