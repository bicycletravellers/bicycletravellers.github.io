title: "Road Pedals vs MTB Pedals for Long-Distance Bikepacking"
description: "On very long rides or bikepacking expeditions, are there any opinions on this group concerning the use of road vs. MTB pedals? I'm a road rider so used to road pedals but I figure if I'm on a bikepacking expedition where I might go offroad or have to walk at some points MTB might be a better bet? And are MTB pedals, which are smaller, still comfortable to ride on during long rides that last several hours?"
