title: "Thoughts on Suspension Seatposts for Bikepacking"
description: "Thoughts on suspension seatposts? I bought a Cane Creek Thudbuster seatpost, used it for a couple of months, and I actually developed worse back problems. It's like it was too bouncy or something. I have had better luck with a traditional spring seatpost. But after I had some back problems with the Thudbuster, I just went to a fixed seatpost and it's been fine."
