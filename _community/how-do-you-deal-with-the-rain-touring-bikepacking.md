title: "How Do You Deal with the Rain when Touring / Bikepacking?"
description: "How do you deal with the rain? I'm planning a couple of trips to Norway and Scotland, both very wet places. I have a Gore ShakeDry jacket and waterproof socks. I also have lightweight Outdoor Research waterproof trousers. Is there anything else you recommend? I have a treated down quilt, but it always gets wet when it rains hard enough and I worry if the sun doesn't come out the next day (which I have yet to face). Do you wash your bibs when it rains day in day out? Is it better to wash them and wear them wet? What about wet feet?"
