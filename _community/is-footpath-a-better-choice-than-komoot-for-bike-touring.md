title: "Is Footpath a Better Choice than Komoot for Bike Touring?"
description: "Komoot seems to be the go to app for planning bike trips, I have, however, found and app called Footpath much more intuitive and better for loops. the best app I have used is Osmand, an offline map with all details. MapOut is a very simple to use App, inexpensive, gives elevation and works without cell service if you download the maps."
