title: "Are Flat Pedals a Good Idea for a Bikepacking Bike?"
description: "I'm building up my bikepacking bike was thinking about trying flat pedals. I imagine it's a personal preference thing but any recommendations? I've been using relatively cheap Shimano M424s for 20+ years and have been happy with them but thought I'd try some flats. I can't believe how expensive some of the flat pedal are though, wow!"
