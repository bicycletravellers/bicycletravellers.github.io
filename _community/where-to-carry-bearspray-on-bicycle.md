title: "Where to Carry Bearspray on a Bicycle"
description: "Looking for a way to carry bearspray other than in a bottle mount. I use a bungee cord and strap it to my seat post. But the one time I actually thought I was being chased by a bear.  I carried my bear spray in there at all times and it was not even uncomfortable."
