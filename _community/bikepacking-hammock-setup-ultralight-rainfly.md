title: "Bikepacking Hammock Setup Ultralight Rainfly"
description: "Filled my backpack with my camping gear and went. Probably the biggest fail of the gear was my rainfly. Just get a tarp and tie a line above the hammock separately. I have a hammock that is designed with a rainfly and tent poles that keep it looped around. I’m curious why you wouldn’t just use a poncho? As someone earlier in the thread suggested, a ridge line made out of para cord with four pieces on each corner."
