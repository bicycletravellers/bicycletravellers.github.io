title: "Saddle Bags with a Rack versus Seat Bags: Difference?"
description: "Is there a benefit to having a rear rack with saddle bags over one of those seat packs (sorry, I don't know what the term is, but the bags that hang off the rear.

Itâ€™s easier to pack and organize panniers because of their shape. "
