title: "Anyone Using an Electric Air Pump for Bicycle Touring?"
description: "I used the xiaomi airpump. Will never ever leave home without it when touring. Looks heavy, and it's just saving you from pumping a manual pump. IMO, not worth the weight, space and expense, not to mention, what if it doesn't work when you need it? You still have to carry a manual pump."
