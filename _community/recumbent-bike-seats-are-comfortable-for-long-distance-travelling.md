title: "Recumbent Bike Seats are Comfortable for Long Distance Travelling"
description: "There's been some discussions about comfortable seats for riding so I thought it might be useful to some to raise a bit of awareness about recumbent bikes.  Looks great but the time I tried a recumbent hills were to hard and NZ is very hilly so triangle frames work best. The recumbent is not that universal but for some specific use cases it can be really awesome"
