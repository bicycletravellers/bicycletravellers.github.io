title: "Prevent Handlebar Bag from Bouncing on the Cables and Frame"
description: "How to fix a handlebar bag and prevent it from bouncing against the cables and frame.I bought an extender but it seems relatively useless as it tends to rotate. I use a similar extender for bikepacking and I angle it down more, try 45 degrees to start with, then place the bag on top, almost like a shelf rather than hanging from. My stem is only 50mm and the bag is nowhere near the head tube."
