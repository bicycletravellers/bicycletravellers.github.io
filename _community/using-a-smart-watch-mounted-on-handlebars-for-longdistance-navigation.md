title: "Using a Smart Watch Mounted on Handlebars for Long-Distance Navigation"
description: "Hi there, does anyone use a smart watch like Garmin Fenix, etc. for navigation on their trips? The watch could be mounted on the handlebar instead of the wrist - example photo attached - but I'm not sure about the usability... I need navigation for long-distance running & hiking as well as bikepacking, but don't have the money to buy a watch AND a bike computer."
