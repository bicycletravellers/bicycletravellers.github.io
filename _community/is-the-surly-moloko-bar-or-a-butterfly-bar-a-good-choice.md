title: "Is the Surly Moloko Bar or a Butterfly Bar a Good Choice?"
description: " Anyone try both the Surly Moloko bar and a butterfly bar?  Trying to decide between them.  For touring I prefer an upright position, but with some options to stretch out.  I recently switched from flared gravel bars to on-one Geoff (like Moloko) and then butterfly and didnâ€™t like either."
