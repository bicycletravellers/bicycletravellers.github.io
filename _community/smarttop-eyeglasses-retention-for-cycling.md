title: "SMARTTOP Eyeglasses Retention for Cycling"
description: "These are the SMARTTOP Eyeglasses retention. You can buy them on Amazon for just under $6 for a pack of 12. They are soft rubber, and can be reused. I bought two packs a year ago thinking id be going through them, but I'm still just using a few from the first opened pack. As you can see in my picture, they simply slip onto your glasses, and sit behind your ear. "
