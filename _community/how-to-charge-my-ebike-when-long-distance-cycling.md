title: "How to Charge My e-Bike when Long-Distance Cycling?"
description: "Where do I find power for my e-bike trek? on the way, sometimes you have to be very inventive to get the necessary watt for your batteries. First always ask or permission. I stay at campgrounds that have power. I stop for a late breakfast and get permission to charge while I eat. If I stop at a gas station or convenience store for a break I ask permission to plug in. Local churches, libraries, and senior centers are a good place. "
