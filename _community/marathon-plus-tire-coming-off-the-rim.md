title: "Marathon Plus Tire Coming off the Rim"
description: "This Marathon Plus tyre 700 x 28C, sidewall pressures 80-110 psi, still has tread. At 100 psi one part of the tyre, the wire bead, is almost coming off the rim. I took all the air out and it all appeared to be seated ok but on pumping up again the same thing happened."
