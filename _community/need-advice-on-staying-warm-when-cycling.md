title: "Need Advice on Staying Warm when Cycling"
description: "I sweat a lot when I ride, which isn’t a problem when I am moving- or when it’s warm. When it chills down I also find I cope with good wicking layers, so long as I keep going. The minute I stop I chill down really quickly. If I wear too many layers, I start warm and end up with everything soaking through - again, only a problem when I stop."
