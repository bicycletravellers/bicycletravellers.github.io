title: "Inflate Sleeping Pad with a Bicycle Pump"
description: "Does anyone know of an adaptor that you would allow you to inflate your sleeping mat with your bike pump? Depends on how you can inflate it. My Klymit has a small hand pump that goes on a spigot. I ditched that and used an old inner valve screwed into a bit of rubber hose I had, the bore was smaller than the spigot so I used a drill to enlarge. "
