title: "What is the General Opinion of the Pinion Gear Box?"
description: "What is the general opinion of a pinion gear-box?  I use to be fascinated with the pinion gear, are they still around havent seen a bike with one in quite some time. Will likely get one on my next bike (for Trekking). They add roughly $1000+ to the price, so be aware. A Rohloff should be perfectly fine, if you don't want to make that leap. The gear range on the Pinion is tops, but you pay a slight weight penalty. It's all tradeoffs. "
