title: "Is 1x or 2x Drivetrain Better for All-Road Touring?"
description: "Is 1x or 2x drivetrain better for all-road touring? I've been transforming my Kona Unit from a single track trail bike to an all-road touring bike... Still riding 3x here. I'd never go 1x. I'm considering 2x only because getting a middle ramped a pinned chainring cost more than buying a new crank and cassette (derailleurs will still work). "
