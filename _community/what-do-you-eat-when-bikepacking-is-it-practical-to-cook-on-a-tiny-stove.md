title: "What Do You Eat When Bikepacking? Is It Practical to Cook on a Tiny Stove?"
description: "I have a question about food. My husband and I have always done our bikepacking trips in hotels etc but we’ve decided it’s time to try camping. I’ve seen there are tiny lightweight stoves available.  I usually only cook breakfast and one or two dinners. I have a hard time packing enough calories with me so I often rely on restaurant/grocery store/gas station takeout along the way (get 1-3 meals to-go). "
