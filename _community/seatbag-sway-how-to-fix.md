title: "Seatbag Sway. How to Fix it?"
description: "Seatbag seems to not be solid and sway. I've tried 3 different named brand saddle bags. They all end up sagging or swaying more than I'd like, nomatter how I pack it. I'm convinced it's just the design, even with the sway, still like them better than pannier bags but the sag did cause me a mini-mental breakdown on the side of the road when I felt like death and I had to keep stopping every 3miles to fix it from rubbing, I solved that problem by just using it for tent/bag and stuff I won't have to unpack until I'm ready to sleep."
