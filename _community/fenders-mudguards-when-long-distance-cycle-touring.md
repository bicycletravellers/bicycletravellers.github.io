title: "Fenders/Mudguards when Long-Distance Cycle Touring?"
description: "Are fenders worth having? Do the pros outweight the cons?  Depends on how much you will ride in winter rain/ snow. I was shortlisting bikes exclusively with fenders, and can’t imagine not having them. I’d say depends on the purpose and geography. Im based in London and commute to the office job, so having fenders was a no question for me."
