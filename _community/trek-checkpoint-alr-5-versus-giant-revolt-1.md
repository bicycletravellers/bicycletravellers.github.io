title: "Trek Checkpoint ALR 5 versus Giant Revolt 1?"
description: " Hello guys! Torn between the giant revolt 1 and trek chexkpoint alr 5. Mountain biking background and wanting to have a dropper post and good gear rations for the climbs. I have a carbon Checkpoint with a 1x and a 52 on the back. I ride that thing on everything from paved road to gravel to Class 4 to single track. It’s got the scratches to show for it. But it is the most comfortable and nimble bike I have ever owned, and I’ve had a lot of bikes."
