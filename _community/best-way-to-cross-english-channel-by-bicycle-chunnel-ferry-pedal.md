title: "Best Way to Cross the English Channel by Bicycle: Chunnel, Ferry, or Pedal?"
description: "I'm looking for the best way to cross the English channel by Bicycle. Chunnel, ferry or pedal?  Definitely don't swim with it, unless it's modified with floaties. Good luck with the pedaling. I've done both chunnel and ferry with a bike, long time ago, but chunnels quicker, ferry more options. Both interesting in their own way."
