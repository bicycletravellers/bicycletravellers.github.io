title: "How do You Prepare Yourself for Bikepacking in Bear Country?"
description: "How you all prepare yourself for cycling in bear country? I'm going to ride the TransAmerica Bicycle Trail this summer and although there is no real dirt section, I'll be going across Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming where grizzlies live. I thought I could get some solid safety tips from people who actually bikepack off-road. I'm specifically thinking about food storage as carrying a bear canister seems almost impossible, as well as what are the safety tips for cycling in Grizzly country?"
