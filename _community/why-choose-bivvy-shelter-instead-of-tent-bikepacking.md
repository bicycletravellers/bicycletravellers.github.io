title: "Why do you Choose a Bivvy Shelter instead of a Tent for Bikepacking?"
description: "I see a lot of people using smaller Bivvy shelters instead of normal sized tents. Is it because theyâ€™re easier to stealth camp with and easier to find spots to position one? I have a Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1 and Durston X-Mid 1p, which I love! But have contemplated on one of these more low profile shelters."
