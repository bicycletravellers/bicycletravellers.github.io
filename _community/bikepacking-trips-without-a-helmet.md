title: "Bikepacking Trips without a Helmet?"
description: "Does anyone here do bikepacking trips without a helmet? I grew up skateboarding which has a bit of an anti-helmet culture. We were given helmets at primary school, my mate set off without his, turned back home to get it, knocked off by a car and had swelling on the brain."
