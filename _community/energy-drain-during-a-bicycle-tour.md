title: "Energy Drain during a Bicycle Tour"
description: "I did my longest ride of 90 miles with it yesterday. But energy in middle was tough, how do you all fuel up? Carb up? easy for some but Keto high fat low carb is the best for some of us as not everyone can process carbs . Nibbling constantly , tippling water every 15 minutes works for many of us. "
