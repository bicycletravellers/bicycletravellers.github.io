title: "Does Anyone Use an E-Bike for Bikepacking?"
description: "Anyone here uses ebike for bikepacking?  E-bikes are super fun. And they allow people with different physical ability levels to enjoy types of cycling they otherwise might not be. bear in mind good vigorous exercise like cycling helps keep you younger though. I know plenty of old guys in cycling club who can still race. Followed my mate up a long hill today. He was on an eBike [he has heart arrhythmia] and whilst I was working really hard, he said it was effortless."
