title: "Bicycle Mirrors That Fit onto Your Helmet?"
description: "I used those mirrors for a while and they are great but a little small and prone to getting knocked off. I now use mirrors which fit into the end of the handlebars. Had one on my glasses, managed to lose them mid ride without noticing. Now I have a helmet one, needed some time to get used to it, but I like it."
