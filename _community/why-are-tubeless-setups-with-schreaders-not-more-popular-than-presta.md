title: "Why Are Tubeless Setups with Schreaders Not More Popular than Presta?"
description: "Why are tubeless setups with schrader valves not more popular? Seems like they are better than presta: bigger hole so easier to seat a tire to the rim, less prone to clogging, valve core isn't easily damaged/bent and the rim can fit a spare tube with a schrader or presta valve with a rim sleeve adaptor."
