title: "Carbon Frames for Bikepacking?"
description: "Are carbon frames worth it? I am looking at a Treck Checkpoint SL5 and a Canyon Inlifte. Carbon is great, just please wrap that new bike with helicopter tape... Also remember it does not like to be very hot.. Think car exhaust, and carbon rims on rear racks. I went back to AL on the Mtn bike, very bombproof, just don't ask how much it weights."
