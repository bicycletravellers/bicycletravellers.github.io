title: "Dangers of Cycle Touring Through France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montengro and Albania?"
description: "We are cycling from the UK to Greece and will be travelling through France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montengro and Albania. Will be wild camping throughout and wondered what dangers we could encounter in each country? If anyone has any warnings whether it be animals, landmines or anything else would be a massive help to let us know!"
