title: "Is It Necessary to Camp when Bike Touring? Can I Stay at Hotels?"
description: "Is it necessary to do camping for bike touring?  How far can you go if you rely on hostels, b&b, motel?  As long as your credit cards last. Depends which part of the country you're in. I live in California so we have mostly camped during our tours. Currently planning Boston to D.C. so will do hotels/hostels along the way"
