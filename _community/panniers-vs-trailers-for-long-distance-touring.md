title: "Panniers vs Trailers for Long-Distance Touring?"
description: "Trailers vs painers?  With panniers I can hop on a bus and get whisked to the other end of the city for a few dollars. Trailer does not offer that option.  Easier to organize your gear. I would prefer using bikepacking bags, but my very small bike frame doesn't carry much."
