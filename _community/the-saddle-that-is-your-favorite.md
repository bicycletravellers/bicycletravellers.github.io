title: "The Saddle That Is Your Favorite?"
description: "What saddle is your favorite!!  Moonsaddle. that was an interesting saddle. Is it really comfortable? Yes it is..takes some getting used too.. Selle Anatomica is what I've ridden for the last 30,000 miles. Wore a couple leather ones out. The R2 looks like it is going to last longer."
