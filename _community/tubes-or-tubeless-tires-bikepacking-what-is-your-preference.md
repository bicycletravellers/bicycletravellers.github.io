title: "Tubes or Tubeless Tires for Bikepacking: What Is Your Preference?"
description: "Tubes or tubeless? What's your preference? Which of the two so you prefer? Why and why not? I'm still using the stock tires on my priority 600x which are the WTB ranger tires. Also, are there tires you can recommend as an all arounder tire? I've been looking at the maxxis ardent, aggressor, and rekon tires. I hear great things about maxxis in general, so figured I'd start with that brand."
