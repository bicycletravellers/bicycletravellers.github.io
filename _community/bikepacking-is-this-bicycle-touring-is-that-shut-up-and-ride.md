description: "Why call it a different activity, just because of how they packs their bags, that makes no sense. Showcases of rigs for bikepacking events can show a wide variety luggage types and amount carried. I use a Tailfin Aero pack, which is a bag mounted on a rack, so by your definition I must be cycle touring even though I may be travelling light on an MTB. "
