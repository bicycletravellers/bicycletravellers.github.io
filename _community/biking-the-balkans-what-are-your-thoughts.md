title: "Biking the Balkans: What Are Your Thoughts?"
description: "Headed over to Europe for my 8th 9-10 week tour and I just wanted to ask - What are your feelings about biking in Poland, the Balkan and the Baltic states. From what I can see there is a panic when it simply comes to cycling Europe. I know the situation is unpredictible and one might feel concern in cycling/coming to the bordering countries (the reservations for the summer dropped nearly 100% in Poland). "
