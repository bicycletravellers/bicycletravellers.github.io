title: "Bent Rear Derailleur on a New Bicycle"
description: "Just bought a brand new bicycle. For those who know, seems like that rear derailleur does not look right, does it?  Very bent indeed. The rear derailleur is bent at the frame! Return it as the frame is compromised! I would do a complete return for a newer undamaged frame and Derailleur mount."
