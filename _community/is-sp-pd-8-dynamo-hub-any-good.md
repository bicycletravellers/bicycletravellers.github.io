title: "Is SP PD-8 Dynamo Hub Any Good?"
description: "What's your opinion and experience with SP PD-8 dynamo hub? Worth puting it on a wheel or better off with a power bank? Works OK if touring away from regular (daily) access to electricity supplies. Pedalcell might be better option if have aluminium rims. SON option is more expensive but has better reputation especially if likely to be dunked or plan to fly with it. as others say is good for lights but need to ride a lot to add meaningful charge to phone or battery pack."
