title: "Exploding of Hunt Carbon Wheels"
description: "Hunt carbon wheels exploding randomly. A lot of people were saying that if itâ€™s a bad tape job then air can enter the cavity of the rim and possibly cause this during inflation.   I am not saying that a tubeless wheel will not ever explode. I am also not saying the story about the exploding Hunt is false. The picture above shows what could be either overinflation of a tire, a failure in the carbon layup or a crash."
