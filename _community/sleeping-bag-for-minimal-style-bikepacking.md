title: "Sleeping Bag for Minimal Style Bikepacking"
description: "What is everyone's opinion on sleeping bags and what kind you use for minimalist style bikepacking. Mine packs down to about the size of a small basketball. I use a down quilt rated to 32F. I sleep warm so it's good to probably close to that in the tent. I'm using a Nature Hike Cloud Up 1 which is a knock off of the Big Agnes Seedhouse for my tent."
