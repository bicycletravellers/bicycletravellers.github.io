title: "Things You Should Know Before Getting into Bikepacking"
description: " What are some things you wish you knew before getting into bikepacking?  That many of the people who have opinions and offer advice about bikepacking have no practical experience and only repeat what... The only people that care about how many miles you did (maybe besides yourself) are the people who have never toured before. The people you meet on the road, in the campsite, etc will always have better stories than you and not one of them will care if you've done 10 miles or 10,000. "
