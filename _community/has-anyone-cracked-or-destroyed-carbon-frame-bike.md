title: "Has Anyone Cracked or Destroyed a Carbon Frame Bike?"
description: "Carbon can fail just like any other material. Carbon failures by major bike manufacturers are highly unlikely as long as you are respecting the weight limits. If you buy cheap carbon then it's more of a possibility. That's why you buy a carbon bike from a quality manufacturer that warranties their products."
