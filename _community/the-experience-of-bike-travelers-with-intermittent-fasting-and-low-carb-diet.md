title: "The Experience of Bike Travelers with Intermittent Fasting and Low Carb Diet"
description: "I would like to know the experience of other bike travelers with intermittent fasting and low carb diet.  I have the feeling that eating a salad during the ride gives me more energy than eating special sports energy bars. So I'd like to know if there are others that also avoid sugar during their trips."
