title: "Cannondale Topstone Bikes: Are They Worth the Money?"
description: "Just comparing these two gravel bikes here (Triban Rc120) and wondering why anyone would pay extra $1000 for the topstone 4 base model. The two bikes have the exact same disk brakes (promax 330r) , microshift components (r8(2x8) vs 1x10 Advent X. Similar frame geometry and a carbon forks for both. "
