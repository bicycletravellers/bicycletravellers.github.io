title: "Are Decathlon Panniers Suitable for Long-Distance Touring?"
description: "I wanted to buy these rear trunk panniers from Decathlon for a few days to  days tour. In the description they write these are for asphalt only and not suitable for touring. A bag is a bag. If you can attach it well to your bike, you'll be OK. They look like they sling over a rear rack, so no worries, there - just make sure they don't get caught up in the rear wheel. "
