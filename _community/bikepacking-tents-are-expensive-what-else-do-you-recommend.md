title: "Bikepacking Tents are Expensive. What Else Do You Recommend?"
description: "Naturehike for sure! Love mine. Bikepacked all through south Island NZ in all sorts of weather including many downpours. Only downside, doesn't have a breathing part so condensation can build up a little. Way cheaper, been excellent. Cloud 2 I think I have?! Sorry bought it a while back. It's a small two man, Y shaped pole I use a Big Agnes Copper Spur. I didn't purchase it specifically for bikepacking. I already had it for backpacking and it works just fine for both."
