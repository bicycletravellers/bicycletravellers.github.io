title: "Are All Bicycle Travellers Tech Nomads?"
description: "I save a bit every month at the same time I do things to save money - don't eat out much when travelling and cook when touring and mostly camp, I want to try Warmshowers in the future, I've accumulated my equipment over time taking advantage of special offers etc, I generally don't go at peak times of the year."
