title: "Hydraulic Brakes for Bike Touring: Difficult to Maintain?"
description: "As I know Hydrolic disc brakes are difficult to maintain. What is your experience with hydrolic brakes for bike touring? I have one bike with hydrolic brakes and one with mechanical. I've never taken the hydrolic one touring, but it was my main ride for the first year I had it. In spite of putting more miles on it, I had to mess with the brakes less than my mechanical brakes."
