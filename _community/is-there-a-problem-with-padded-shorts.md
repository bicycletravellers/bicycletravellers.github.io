title: "The Reason Why People are NOT Using Soft Bicycle Saddles"
description: "HOW in the world do people use these hard saddles? They make my butt hurt just looking at them. I have a few saddles and have rotated through them and the only ones I can sit on have lots of gel/memory foam type padding or I can barely sit down. Or are the people using those hard seats all wearing the special padded bloomers?"
