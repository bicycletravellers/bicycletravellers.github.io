title: "Attaching Seat Pack on Dropper Post"
description: "Cons of mounting a saddle bag onto a dropper post, assuming I won't use it on the trip. Rather switch to a regular seatpost?  Wolftooth valais with a Wayward Riders. I have been using a dropper post specifc saddle bag with zero issues for 4 years and counting. The Bedrock Black Dragon comes with a wolf tooth valais, so in the event you have a dropper post failure, you can lock the post in place. "
