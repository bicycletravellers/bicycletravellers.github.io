title: "Keeping the Foot Dry on Long-Distance Bicycle Tours"
description: "After 6 days of nice weather I got two days with a lot of rain. Big challenge to keep the shoes and feet dry. How do you keep your feet dry. I use the combination one pair of shoes, one pair of sandals and two pairs of merino wool socks. I wonder if there are any better alternatives?"
