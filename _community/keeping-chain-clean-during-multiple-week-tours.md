title: "Keeping Chain Clean during Multiple Week Tours?"
description: "how do you yâ€™all keep your chain clean during multiple week tour.  Keep a tooth brush or something with you to get the crud out, and maybe a rag and chain lube. A crunchy drivetrain is no fun for sure. I carry a cleaning brush. Kept in a Ziploc bag. Don't bother trying to keep it pristine, just keep it wet, since a wet layer of oily fine silt actually helps insulate it from worse things AND helps it derail easier during gear changes"
