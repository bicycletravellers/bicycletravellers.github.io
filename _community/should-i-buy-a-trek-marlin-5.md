title: "Should I Buy a Trek Marlin 5"
description: "I’m after a new hard trail mountain bike. I’m considering buying Trek Marlin 5 and would like to know what you think about it and if there’s anything better for the same price. I'm a mountain bike tour operator , we use 30 trek marlin 6, since 2017, and very satisfied, all our guests love them . We cycled them 1000s of miles from Myanmar to Singapore, and the remotest mountain areas in Myanmar and Thailand, as well as on the roads and streets of the cities in Myanmar."
