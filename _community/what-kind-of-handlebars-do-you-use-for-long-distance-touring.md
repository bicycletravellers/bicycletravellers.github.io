title: "What Kind of Handlebars Do You Use for Long-Distance Touring?"
description: "What type of handlebars do all of you use on a multi day tour?  I'll put a good word in for butterfly handlebars... lots of alternatives for where to put your hands I've always found them confortable Really liking this Blendr setup on my Trek with a riser bar. A quill with built in adjustable stem. Up/down, back/forth, with a riser to spin and adjust for angle."
