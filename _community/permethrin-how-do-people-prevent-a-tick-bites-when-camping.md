title: "Permethrin: How Do People Prevent a Tick Bites when Camping"
description: "I'm primarily concerned about ticks, not mosquitos. I’m planning on using permethrin for the first time for an upcoming trip. How do folks apply it to prevent the most likely scenario where  a tick lands on your shoe/lower leg and crawls up your leg? Do you apply it to long socks, or use some sort of leg covering? What garments DON’T you spray it on?"
