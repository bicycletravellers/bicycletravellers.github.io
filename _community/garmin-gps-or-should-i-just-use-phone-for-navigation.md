title: "Garmin GPS or Should I Just Use a Phone for Navigation?"
description: "I’m debating on splurging on a nice Garmin GPS, or could I get by with just using my phone in Bike mode temporarily? I know that a dedicated bike gps will overall be better, but $400 is a nice chunk. Bought a Garmin 1030 a couple of years back & it’s been one of the best purchases I’ve ever made! "
